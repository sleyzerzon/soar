How to build the SoarJavaDebugger
=================================

March 2005	Douglas Pearson

A) Windows Instructions
***********************

Eclipse
=======

1) Building in Eclipse (free Java IDE from www.eclipse.org).
   a) Create a new Eclipse project (File | New | Project)
   b) Select "Java Project"
   c)  i) Project Name: SoarJavaDebugger
      ii) Location: Create at external location and browse to this file's folder
     iii) Finish.
   d) At this point the debugger should build.
   e) To run create a run configuration and run it
      (under Run | Debug... | Java Application setting main class to debugger.Application).

2) To create a JAR file from within Eclipse select the JARDescription.jardesc file, right click and "Open Jar Packager..." and follow the wizard (some values like the output JAR path may need updating).  Use the JarManifest file as the manifest.

JDK directly
============

1) Building using just the Java JDK.
   From the SoarJavaDebugger folder (the current folder matters):
   "javac.exe -classpath .;swt.jar debugger\Application.java"
   (on Linux: -classpath .:swt.jar -- i.e. ":" instead of ";")

2) Creating JAR file:
   From the SoarJavaDebugger folder:
   "jar.exe cvfm ..\SoarJavaDebugger.jar JarManifest ."
   (watch the trailing ".")

3) Run the JAR file with
   "cd .." (to where the SoarJavaDebugger.jar is located)
   "java.exe -jar SoarJavaDebugger.jar"

B) Linux/MacOS Instructions
***************************

The Windows approach should broadly work, but you'll need to supply your own copy of the SoarIO DLLs and swt.jar and DLLs (.so's) to replace the included ones which are all Windows versions.

javac -classpath .:swt.jar debugger/Application.java
jar cvfm ../SoarJavaDebugger.jar JarManifest .
