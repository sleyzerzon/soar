# Building Soar #

If you wish to manually build Soar rather than downloading [pre-compiled binaries](Downloads.md), for example if you want to make modification or extensions to the architecture, you can perform the following steps:

  * **Step 1**: Get the source code by either downloading it or checking it out from our version control repository.
    * [Instructions for getting the source code](BuildGetSource.md)
  * **Step 2**: Follow the build instructions for your particular operating system
    * [Windows Build Notes](BuildWindows.md)
    * [Linux Build Notes](BuildLinux.md)
    * [Mac OS X Build Notes](BuildMac.md)
  * **Step 3**: Set up Eclipse if you plan to use it for development _(optional)_
