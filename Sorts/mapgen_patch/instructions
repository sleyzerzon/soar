Copy the files to these locations in the ORTS tree, then make orts:
apps/orts/src/orts_main.C
libs/serverclient/src/MapTool.C
libs/serverclient/src/MapTool.H
libs/serverclient/src/SoarMap.function

Put the map_settings_example file wherever. To run with a Soar map, put the settings file in the command line after -soar.

ex: bin/orts -soar map_settings_example

See inside map_settings_example for detailed info on the maps.
