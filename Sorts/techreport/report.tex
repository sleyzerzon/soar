\section{ORTS Overview}

The Open Real Time Strategy software is a highly configurable game
engine used to play real time strategy (RTS) games \cite{ORTS}. The main
purpose for ORTS is to serve as an open source, open interface RTS game
engine for RTS AI tournaments. ORTS is undergoing active development as
of July 2006 at the University of Alberta under the direction of Michael
Buro.

There are several reasons why ORTS is especially suitable for use in
AI tournaments. It has a (relatively) straightforward C++ API, making
interfacing with your favorite AI system easy. All the specific game
mechanics, ranging from types of units, actions, and physics, are
specified via C++ style scripts called blueprints. This means that ORTS
can be easily configured to simulate a wide range of environments,
from arbitrarily simple ones like Wumpus World to complex ones like
Starcraft. Finally, ORTS has a client/server architecture in which
the server maintains the state of the world and only report to the
clients information they are supposed to have for a fair game. This
is in contrast to most commercial RTS games, in which each client
maintains the entire world state and prevents the player from accessing
forbidden information such as other players' locations only by hiding
them from the GUI. The result is that ORTS is impervious to "memory
hack" cheats that are widespread in commercial RTS games. This feature
is particularly important if tournaments are to be run across the
Internet.

\section{SORTS Overview}

SORTS is a piece of software that allows the Soar cognitive architecture
to act as a client to the ORTS game server, so that ORTS game playing
agents can be written in and executed on Soar. SORTS is much more than
an interface bridge in that it intentionally constrains the space of
possible Soar agents in important ways and also handles aspects of
low-level game control that are not suitable for Soar. In particular,
SORTS heavily abstracts the world state information obtained from
the ORTS API before feeding them into Soar as perceptions, and also
interprets and executes high-level commands from Soar as low-level
actions sent to the ORTS API.
