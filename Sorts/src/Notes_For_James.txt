The SoarGameObjects need setGroup() and getGroup() added.

	- *** Done ***

Pahtfinding:
- Pathfinding is always done with A*
	- A* can be slow
	- Doing A* on tiles can be extremely slow
	- Region-based approach is much better
		- Nodes of the graph are regions.
		- Traversal through regions is done in a straight line.
		- Once you are in target region, you can go directly to your spot	
		- A problem is the inclusion of dynamic elements
			- Requires good definition of regions.
			- This could be done with A* on tiles (much more restricted set)
	- Interface
		- list<Tile *> pathfind(Tile *, Tile *);
		- list<Tile *> pathfind(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);

	- Iterations
		- Implement tile A* (useful for small maps)
		- Test
		- Implement region A* (useful for large maps)
		- Test
