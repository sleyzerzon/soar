                                    Synopsis

 firing-counts [n]
 firing-counts production_name

                                    Options

   If given, an option can take one of two forms -- an integer or a
   production name:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |n              |List the top n productions. If n is 0, only the         |
   |               |productions which haven't fired are listed              |
   |---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
   |production_name|Print how many times the production has fired           |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

                                  Description

   The firing-counts command prints the number of times each production has
   fired; production names are given from most requently fired to least
   frequently fired. With no arguments, it lists all productions. If an
   integer argument, n, is given, only the top n productions are listed. If n
   is zero (0), only the productions that haven't fired at all are listed. If
   a production name is given as an argument, the firing count for that
   production is printed.

   Note that firing counts are reset by a call to init-soar.

                                    Examples

   This example prints the 10 productions which have fired the most times
   along with their firing counts:

 firing-counts 10

   This example prints the firing counts of production my*first*production:

 firing-counts my*first*production


                                    Warnings

   Firing-counts are reset to zero after an init-soar.

   NB: This command is slow, because the sorting takes time O(n*log n)
