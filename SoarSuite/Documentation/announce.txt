Announcing Soar 8.6.2!
======================

This announcement describes the primary changes in this latest release.

This release covers Windows and Linux (OS X forthcoming).

Soar 8.6.2 can be downloaded from the Soar homepage at:

http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

Requirements
============

* Java 1.4.2 or later required to use the Java debugger (java should be 
  available in the path). Get it at http://java.sun.com/. Most machines 
  probably already have this installed.

* If you want to run Tcl applications on Linux, Tcl 8.4.x or later is
  required (note that the tutorial applications are now available in
  Java).  Also note that we do not currently support threaded builds
  of Tcl (e.g. ActiveTcl 8.4.11.2 or later).

New in this release
===================

* Capabilities added:
  -- C# added to list of supported languages (now C++, Java, Tcl, C#).
  -- Eaters and TankSoar rewritten in Java.
  -- The "stop-point" in the decision cycle can now be changed (by
     default Soar will stop between the decision and application
     phases).
  -- Tcl commands can now be used within the debugger by running a separate
     Tcl filter alongside the debugger (preliminary version in this release).
  -- Filtering of command line input allowed in any language and can be chained
  -- New SML tutorial (in Environments/JavaTOH)
  -- Added support for arbitrary communication from one client to another (not just to/from the kernel)
  -- Multiple agents can now be interleaved by decision cycle or by output, as well as by phase.
  -- Support for arbitrary logging of Soar execution through custom logging applications added
  -- Support for logging output in debugger on a window by window basis
  -- Java 5.0 supported.
  -- Visual Studio 2005 supported.

* Performance further improved:
  -- Windows performance improved (30+% faster in Towers of Hanoi SML).
  -- Vastly improved Linux performance (~20x in some cases).
  -- Java versions of Eaters and TankSoar are many times faster than
     their Tcl equivalents.

* Updates and fixes
  -- Reorganized directory structure to be more logical.
  -- Static libraries required for building SML applications are now
     distributed in SoarLibrary/lib.
  -- Many memory leaks fixed.
  -- init-soar works much better.
  -- Updated Java apps to SWT 3.1.2.
  -- Java Debugger now uses GTK interface by default in Linux (fixes
     many motif-specific bugs).
  -- Lots of SML changes to improve correctness and functionality.
  -- Several Soar7-mode commands added.
  -- Registering for callbacks in Java now uses interfaces.
  -- Soar kernel now uses a new random number generator.
  -- Lots of documentation updates.
  -- Many, many other changes (see bugzilla for details).
  
Known issues:
=============

* TankSoar and Eaters have some redraw issues (forcing a redraw, e.g. by
  moving the window, fixes this).
* Remote connections on Linux can be slow.
* ^status complete comes in immediately instead of during input phase.
* The Soar 7 mode implementation currently relies on an ugly hack. If you
  experience problems in this mode, please let us know.
* Many other minor issues (see bugzilla for details).
