Soar 8.6.3 Release Notes
========================

Soar-8.6.3 includes all source code, many demo programs, and a 
number of applications that serve as examples of how to interface 
Soar to an external Environment.  There is support for integrating 
Soar with C++, Java, Tcl, Python and C# applications.  Many Tools
that aid in development of Soar programs are also included.

These Release Notes describe the primary changes in this 
latest release.  More detailed information can be obtained at 
http://winter.eecs.umich.edu/soarwiki

This release was generated for Windows and Linux systems.
OS X support is pending a volunteer willing to work on it.

Soar 8.6.3 can be downloaded from the Soar homepage at:

Installation Requirements
=========================

* On Windows, the 19MB download file expands to ~46MB when installed.  
  Linux disk requirements are similar.

* Java 1.4.2 or newer is required to use the SoarJavaDebugger, which is
  required for most of the demos and applications.  (java must be 
  available in the path). Get it at http://java.sun.com/. Most operating
  systems probably already have Java installed.

* If you want to run Tcl applications on Linux, Tcl 8.4.x or later is
  required (note that the tutorial applications are now available in
  Java).  Also note that we do not currently support threaded builds
  of Tcl (e.g. ActiveTcl 8.4.11.2 or later).

* The included Python libraries support Python 2.4.  Python 2.5 support
  requires a rebuild of the ClientSMLPython project.


Components of Soar 8.6.3

* pre-built libraries and executables for Windows (SoarLibrary/bin)
* all source code, config files, and OS tools for automated Soar builds
* SoarJavaDebugger 
* VisualSoar
* JavaEaters, JavaTankSoar, TclEaters
* Test and Demo programs
* Documentation


New in 8.6.3
============

* Components and Capabilities added
  -- Added support for multiple clients modifying different parts of the
     input link
  -- Added Python support
     -- Requires use of --enable-python configure flag on Linux
  -- Added CheckForIncomingEvents to help single-threaded applications
  -- Matches command can now generate XML output
  -- Added max-memory-usage command (not yet functional)
  -- Watching wmes (level 4 and higher) now reports GDS changes
  -- Added "after halted" event
  -- Improved output of the "preferences" command for Soar8.  New arg
     "--objects" added.  Invoke "help preferences" for usage
     -- New alias "support" added for "preferences"
     -- Right-clicking on identifiers and attributes in debugger allows
        "preferences" and "preferences --object" to be selected
  -- added TestSMLPerformance project
  -- Added ^status error support to TankSoar
  -- TankSoar can now be configured to stop after a specified number of
     updates
  -- Reset in TankSoar/Eaters now returns agents to starting locations
     if specified

* Bug fixes
  -- Lots of TankSoar and Eaters bugfixes
  -- Fixed command-to-file command
  -- Fixed alias command for adding flags to aliases; previously the
     flags were sometimes interpreted as flags for the alias command
     itself rather than the command for which an alias was being 
     created.  "alias" no longer takes any flags.  use "unalias" to
     remove defined aliases.
  -- An empty string can now be returned by a client message handler
  -- Fixed handling of comments by sp
  -- Fixed lots of memory leaks (including some very old ones in the
     kernel)
  -- Debugger bug fixes
     -- properly handle right-clicks in horizontally-scrolled window
     -- recognize identifiers in preferences command output for
        right-click purposes
  -- fixed up logging example apps (LoggerCWin, LoggerJava)
  -- Several other minor fixes

* Other updates
  -- Minor performance improvements (~5%)
  -- Windows builds now done with Visual Studio 2005
     -- Now use Microsoft C library dlls
     -- VS2003 solution/project files still available
  -- Cleaned up Java build batch files on Windows
  -- Cleaned up Linux builds somewhat
  -- Updated to SWT 3.2.0


Known issues:
=============

* TankSoar and Eaters have some redraw issues (forcing a redraw, e.g. by
  moving the window, fixes this).
* Remote connections on Linux can be slow.
* ^status complete appears on the ^output-link immediately instead 
  of during the next input phase.
* The Soar 7 mode implementation currently relies on an ugly hack. If
  you experience problems in this mode, please let us know.
* In TankSoar, the obscure-bot sometimes generates a scary-looking
  kernel error message.  It appears to be safe to ignore.
* Many other minor issues (see bugzilla for details).
