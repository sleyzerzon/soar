                                  Description

   This command defines new aliases by creating Soar procedures with the
   given name. The new procedure can then take an arbitrary number of
   arguments which are post-pended to the given definition and then that
   entire string is executed as a command. The definition must be a single
   command, multiple commands are not allowed. The alias procedure checks to
   see if the name already exists, and does not destroy existing procedures
   or aliases by the same name. Existing aliases can be removed by using the
   unalias command. With no arguments, alias returns the list of defined
   aliases. With only the name given, alias returns the current definition.

                                    Examples

   The alias wmes is defined as:

 alias wmes print -i

   If the user executes a command such as:

 wmes {(* ^superstate nil)}

   it is as if the user had typed this command:

 print -i {(* ^superstate nil)}

   To check what a specific alias is defined as, you would type

 alias wmes
