With no arguments, the memories command prints memory usage for all productions. If a <i>production_name</i> is specified, memory usage will be printed only for that production. If a positive integer <i>n</i> is given, only <i>n</i> productions will be printed: the <i>n</i> productions that use the most memory. Output may be restricted to print memory usage for particular types of productions using the command options. <p>Memory usage is recorded according to the tokens that are allocated in the rete network for the given production(s). This number is a function of the number of elements in working memory that match each production. Therefore, this command will not provide useful information at the beginning of a Soar run (when working memory is empty) and should be called in the middle (or at the end) of a Soar run. <p>The <b>memories</b> command is used to find the productions that are using the most memory and, therefore, may be taking the longest time to match (this is only a heuristic). By identifying these productions, you may be able to rewrite your program so that it will run more quickly. Note that memory usage is just a heuristic measure of the match time: A production might not use much memory relative to others but may still be time-consuming to match, and excising a production that uses a large number of tokens may not speed up your program, because the Rete matcher shares common structure among different productions. <p>As a rule of thumb, numbers less than 100 mean that the production is using a small amount of memory, numbers above 1000 mean that the production is using a large amount of memory, and numbers above 10,000 mean that the production is using a <i>very</i> large amount of memory. <a name="See_Also"></a><h1><span class="mw-headline"> See Also </span></h1><p><a href="/soarwiki/Matches" title="Matches">matches</a><div class="visualClear"></div></div></div></div><div class="visualClear"></div></div></body></html>
