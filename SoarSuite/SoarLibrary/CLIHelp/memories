                                  Description

   The memories command prints out the internal memory usage for full and
   partial matches of production instantiations, with the productions using
   the most memory printed first. With no arguments, the memories command
   prints memory usage for all productions. If a production_name is
   specified, memory usage will be printed only for that production. If a
   positive integer n is given, only n productions will be printed: the n
   productions that use the most memory. Output may be restricted to print
   memory usage for particular types of productions using the command
   options.

   Memory usage is recorded according to the tokens that are allocated in the
   rete network for the given production(s). This number is a function of the
   number of elements in working memory that match each production.
   Therefore, this command will not provide useful information at the
   beginning of a Soar run (when working memory is empty) and should be
   called in the middle (or at the end) of a Soar run.

   The memories command is used to find the productions that are using the
   most memory and, therefore, may be taking the longest time to match (this
   is only a heuristic). By identifying these productions, you may be able to
   rewrite your program so that it will run more quickly. Note that memory
   usage is just a heuristic measure of the match time: A production might
   not use much memory relative to others but may still be time-consuming to
   match, and excising a production that uses a large number of tokens may
   not speed up your program, because the Rete matcher shares common
   structure among different productions.

   As a rule of thumb, numbers less than 100 mean that the production is
   using a small amount of memory, numbers above 1000 mean that the
   production is using a large amount of memory, and numbers above 10,000
   mean that the production is using a very large amount of memory.
