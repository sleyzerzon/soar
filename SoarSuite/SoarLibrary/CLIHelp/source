                                  Description

   Load and evaluate the contents of a file. The filename can be a relative
   path or a fully qualified path. source will generate an implicit push to
   the new directory, execute the command, and then pop back to the current
   working directory from which the command was issued.

   After the source completes, the number of productions sourced and excised
   is printed:

 agent> source demos/mac/mac.soar
 ******************
 Total: 18 productions sourced.
 Source finished.
 agent> source demos/mac/mac.soar
 #*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*
 Total: 18 productions sourced. 18 productions excised.
 Source finished.

   This can be disabled by using the -d flag:

 agent> source demos/mac/mac.soar -d
 ******************
 Source finished.
 agent> source demos/mac/mac.soar -d
 #*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*
 Source finished.

   A list of excised productions is available using the -v flag:

 agent> source demos/mac/mac.soar -v
 #*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*
 Total: 18 productions sourced. 18 productions excised.
 Excised productions:
         mac*detect*state*success
         mac*evaluate*state*failure*more*cannibals
         monitor*move-boat
         monitor*state*left
 ...

   A separate summary for each file sourced can be enabled using the -a flag:

 agent> source demos/mac/mac.soar -a
 _firstload.soar: 0 productions sourced.
 all_source.soar: 0 productions sourced.
 **
 goal-test.soar: 2 productions sourced.
 ***
 monitor.soar: 3 productions sourced.
 ****
 search-control.soar: 4 productions sourced.
 top-state.soar: 0 productions sourced.
 elaborations_source.soar: 0 productions sourced.
 _readme.soar: 0 productions sourced.
 **
 initialize-mac.soar: 2 productions sourced.
 *******
 move-boat.soar: 7 productions sourced.
 mac_source.soar: 0 productions sourced.
 mac.soar: 0 productions sourced.
 Total: 18 productions sourced.
 Source finished.

   Combining the -a and -v flag adds excised production names to the output
   for each file.
