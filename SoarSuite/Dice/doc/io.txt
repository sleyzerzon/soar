output-link
	compute-dice-probability
		id (any) user-data to be copied to input-link to correlate result
		number-of-dice (int) (1..)
		number-of-faces (int) (1..) usually 3 (normal, ones wild) or 6 (ones or special rules)
		count (int) (1..number-of-dice) Target number
		predicate (string) (equal not-equal greater-than-equal greater-than less-than-equal less-than)

Examples:

id: 1, number-of-dice: 3, number-of-faces: 6, count: 2, predicate: equal
yields: id: 1, probability: 0.69444

id: 2.0, number-of-dice: 5, number-of-faces: 3, count: 3, predicate: greater-than-equal
yields: id: 2.0, probability: 0.20988

id: charlie, number-of-dice: 24, number-of-faces: 6, count: 6, predicate less-than
yields: id: charlie, probability: 0.80047
