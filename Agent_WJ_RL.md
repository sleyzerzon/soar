# Water Jug Reinforcement Learning Agent #
This agent demonstrates how to solve the water jug problem using reinforcement learning.  It is a modification of the [Simple Water Jug Agent](Agent_WJ_Simple.md).  Two main changes are made:  templates are used to generate the full space of possible moves that the agent can perform and rewards are set based on the problem solution.
