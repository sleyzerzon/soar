There are some places where we make specific references to the location of Soar, Tcl, or the TSI, or to a specific version of one of these.  Below is a list of those places so a user who chooses to install in some alternate directory structure can change the references to make things work.  Also, cases where a different version may also work (i.e. a newer version of the TSI) are listed.  This list is probably only partial.

1)	soar-8.3.5
	a.	SoarInterface VC++ project
		i.	Links to tcl83.dll
		1.	May want to use a different version of Tcl
	b.	start-soar.tcl
		i.	set tsi_library  [file join [file join [pwd] ..] tsi-3.1.5]
			1.	May want to specify a different version of the TSI here
	c.	Desktop/programs shortcuts
		i.	assume wish.exe exists in C:\Tcl\bin
			1.	Tcl may be installed elsewhere
			2.	May not have wish.exe (i.e. may have wish83.exe)
	d.	Tsi-3.1.5
		i.	$name eval {package require Tk}
			1.	this line may not work with some Tcl installs or versions
				a.	error message says can't find package Tk
			2.	can replace with one of the following (should be in file, commented out)
				a.	load tk83.dll Tk $name
				b.	load {} Tk $name
2)	soar-8.4.5
	a.	SoarInterface VC++ project
		i.	Links to tcl83.dll
			1.	May want to use a different version of Tcl
	b.	start-soar.tcl
		i.	set tsi_library  [file join [file join [pwd] ..] tsi-3.1.5]
			1.	May want to specify a different version of the TSI here
	c.	Desktop/programs shortcuts
		i.	assume wish.exe exists in C:\Tcl\bin
			1.	Tcl may be installed elsewhere
			2.	May not have wish.exe (i.e. may have wish83.exe)
3)	sgio-1.0.5
	a.	InstallShield Installer
		i.	Sets user environment variable TCL_LIBRARY = C:\Tcl\lib\tcl8.3
			1.	Tcl may be installed elsewhere
			2.	May want to use a different version of Tcl
			3.	May want to set a system variable so it works for all users
			4.	NOTE: It is not understood why this variable is required (it isn't required for any of the other packages)
	b.	Shared VC++ project
		i.	Additional include directory: c:\Tcl\include
			1.	Tcl may be installed elsewhere
	c.	Soarside VC++ project
		i.	Links to tcl83.dll and tk83.dll
			1.	May want to use a different version of Tcl
		ii.	Additional include directory: c:\Tcl\include
			1.	Tcl may be installed elsewhere
		iii.	Additional library path: C:\Tcl\lib\
			1.	Tcl may be installed elsewhere
		iv.	Program arguments (for launching from within Visual Studio)
			1.	May have to change to reflect desired port number and init file name and path
	d.	Simside VC++ project
		i.	Additional include directory: ..\..\soar-8.4.5\kernel
			1.	May want to compile with files from a different version of Soar
4)	eaters-3.0.5
	a.	start-eaters.tcl
		i.	set soar_library [file join [file join [pwd] ..] [file join "soar-8.3.5" "library"]]
			1.	Notice the directory is relative to the eaters dir
				a.	May want to specify an absolute path, i.e. if located on a different drive or directory tree
			2.	May want to specify a different version of Soar here
		ii.	set tsi_library  [file join [file join [pwd] ..] tsi-3.1.5]
			1.	Notice the directory is relative to the eaters dir
				a.	May want to specify an absolute path, i.e. if located on a different drive or directory tree
			2.	May want to specify a different version of the TSI here
	b.	Desktop/programs shortcuts
		i.	assume wish.exe exists in C:\Tcl\bin
			1.	Tcl may be installed elsewhere
			2.	May not have wish.exe (i.e. may have wish83.exe)
5)	tanksoar-3.0.5
	a.	start-tanksoar.tcl
		i.	set soar_library [file join [pwd] [file join .. [file join "soar-8.3.5" "library"]]]
			1.	Notice the directory is relative to the tanksoar dir
				a.	May want to specify an absolute path, i.e. if located on a different drive or directory tree
			2.	May want to specify a different version of Soar here
		ii.	set tsi_library [file join [pwd] [file join .. "tsi-3.1.5"]]
			1.	Notice the directory is relative to the tanksoar dir
				a.	May want to specify an absolute path, i.e. if located on a different drive or directory tree
			2.	May want to specify a different version of the TSI here
	b.	Desktop/programs shortcuts
		i.	assume wish.exe exists in C:\Tcl\bin
			1.	Tcl may be installed elsewhere
			2.	May not have wish.exe (i.e. may have wish83.exe)
