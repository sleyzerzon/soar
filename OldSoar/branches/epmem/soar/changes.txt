Changes since last version:

1) Standardized directory structure.  By default, everything is expected to be
	 installed in directories located off of C:\Soar, like this:
	 
	Soar
		eaters-3.0.5
		sgio-1.0.5
        soar-8.3.5
		soar-8.4.5
		tanksoar-3.0.5

2) The .5 designation at the end of the version number indicates that the
	 project has been updated to be Tcl8.3 compatible.  Also, the build procedures
	 were cleaned up a bit.

3) Everything assumes that Tcl8.3 is installed in the default location (C:\Tcl).

4) Eaters, TankSoar, and SGIO no longer come with their own copies of the Soar
	 kernel.  For Eaters and TankSoar, it is assumed that soar-8.3.5 is installed.
	 For SGIO, it is assumed that soar-8.4.5 is installed.

5) There have been changes to soarside’s command line arguments and some details
	 of how it works.  See the documentation included with SGIO for details.

6) Soar-8.4.5 now includes binaries and TSI-3.1.5.

7) Some new examples were added to the SGIO examples directory.

8) Some other minor bug fixes and details changed.

9) Soar and related projects are now under a FreeBSD license.

Known issues:

1) The installers require MSI-2.0 (Microsoft’s installer technology) to be
	 installed already.  Windows XP already has this, but some Windows 2000 and
	 earlier machines may not.  It can be obtained at the following locations:

	For Winows 95, 98, Me

2) SGIO doesn’t work with Tcl8.4.  Everything else seems to work with Tcl8.4
	 with a recompile (with build options updated to look at the Tcl8.4
	 libraries), but we still recommend Tcl8.3.  If you want to use Tcl8.4, see
	 #10 for changes you may have to make.

3) The installer should default to C:\Soar\whatever, but in for unknown reasons
	 on some machines it has defaulted to different drive.  Unless you’re ready to
	 mess with stuff, be sure to install to the C drive.  If you are ready to mess
	 with stuff, see #10.

4) Sometimes the desktop/programs shortcuts aren’t removed on uninstall.  This
	 seems to particularly affect Eaters and TankSoar when they are installed
	 together. These can be safely removed manually.

5) The uninstallers only remove files that were originally installed.  If
	 additional files have since been added, i.e. intermediate files from a
	 rebuild, etc, those files and their directories will be left on the drive.

6) If you wish to use these releases on a CAEN machine, it is easiest to install
	 ActiveTcl on that machine.  Tcl is preinstalled, but not in the default
	 locations, so shortcuts (and a couple other things) will need to be updated.
	 If you want to use SGIO, you must install ActiveTcl on that machine.  Due to
	 permissions issues, it doesn’t seem possible to get SGIO to work with the
	 preinstalled Tcl.  Finally, again due to permissions issues, it doesn’t seem
	 possible to put the Tcl binaries in the path, so to run soarside.exe, the
	 Tcl83.dll and Tk83.dll files must be copied to the soarside directory.

7) The SoarInterface-8.3.5 and 8.4.5 libraries crash when you try to create an
	 agent from the agent control panel if they are compiled in Debug mode with
	 Tcl8.3.5.  This problem does not occur with Tcl8.4.

8) In rare cases, the 8-puzzle demo in Soar-8.4.5 doesn’t load on first try.
	 Trying a second time should work.  This may also affect other demos and other
	 versions of Soar, but the difficulty in reproducing the issue made testing
	 difficult.

9) The wish.exe process doesn’t go away on Windows machines if the agent control
	 panel is closed by clicking the window’s “x” button.  The process goes away
	 correctly if the “quit” button is used.  It isn’t known if this affects other
	 operating systems.

10) Changes to the default configuration need to be made manually, i.e. if you
	  wish to use a different version of Tcl or install to a different location.
	  Some changes you may need or want to make are listed in the
	  "Install Info.doc" file included with each installation.
