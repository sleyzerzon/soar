                                  Description

   Manually add an element to working memory. add-wme is often used by an
   input function to update Soar's information about the state of the
   external world.

   add-wme adds a new wme with the given id, attribute, value and optional
   preference. The given id must be an existing identifier. The attribute and
   value fields can be any Soar symbol. If * is given in the attribute or
   value field, Soar creates a new identifier (symbol) for that field. If the
   preference is given, it can only have the value + to indicate that an
   acceptable preference should be created for this wme.

   [edit]

                                    Examples

   This example adds the attribute/value pair "message-status received" to
   the identifier (symbol) S1:

  add-wme S1 ^message-status received

   This example adds an attribute/value pair with an acceptable preference to
   the identifier (symbol) Z2. The attribute is "message" and the value is a
   unique identifier generated by Soar. Note that since the ^ is optional, it
   has been left off in this case.

  add-wme Z2 message * +

                                    Warnings

   Be careful how you use this command. It may have weird side effects
   (possibly even including system crashes). For example, the chunker can't
   backtrace through wmes created via add-wme, nor will such wmes ever be
   removed thru Soar's garbage collection. Manually removing context/impasse
   wmes may have unexpected side effects.

On Success

   param = value, type = int, the value is the timetag of the new wme

   Perhaps this should be param = timetag? type = unsigned long?--Jonathan
