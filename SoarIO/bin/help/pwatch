                                  Description

   The pwatch command enables and disables the tracing of the firings and
   retractions of individual productions. This is a companion command to
   watch, which cannot specify individual productions by name.

   With no arguments, pwatch lists the productions currently being traced.
   With one production-name argument, pwatch enables tracing the production;
   --enable can be explicitly stated, but it is the default action.

   If --disable is specified followed by a production-name, tracing is turned
   off for the production. When no production-name is specified, pwatch
   --enable lists all productions currently being traced, and pwatch
   --disable disables tracing of all productions.

   Note that pwatch now only takes one production per command. Use multiple
   times to watch multiple functions.
