                                  Description

   The max-memory-usage command is used to trigger the memory usage exceeded
   event. The initial value of this is 100MB (100,000,000); allowable
   settings are any integer greater than 0. The code supporting this event is
   commented out by default in the release build. The test can be
   computationally expensive and is needed only for specific embedded
   applications. Users may enable the test and event generation by
   uncommenting code in SoarKernel/src/mem.cpp.

   Using the command with no arguments displays the current limit.
