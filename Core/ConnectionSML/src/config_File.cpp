/**
 * Port of a configuration file utility used in Soar2D so that it is available
 * for use in C++. Not sure if we're even going to need it. This is essentially
 * an exercise in porting Java straight to C++.
 *
 * Original: SoarSuite/Environments/Soar2D/src/soar2d/config/
 *   Config.java
 *   ConfigFile.java
 *   ConfigSource.java
 *   ConfigUtil.java
 *
 * Until the initial port is done and working:
 *  * Memory issues such as who owns what pointers when is getting pushed aside
 *  * Everything is going to throw std::exception on errors, will sort out later
