# Counting Agent #
Agents that can count in nine different ways.

The real purpose of this agent is to provide various test of Soar's execution:
  1. Long runs
  1. Lots of working memory
  1. Various subgoals/impasses and results with chunking
  1. Lots of chunks/results
  1. Nasty conditions for chunking
  1. Should find any memory leaks.
