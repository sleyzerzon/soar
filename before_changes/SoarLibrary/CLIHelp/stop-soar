                                  Description

   The stop-soar command stops any running Soar agents. It sets a flag in the
   Soar kernel so that Soar will stop running at a "safe" point and return
   control to the user. This command is usually not issued at the command
   line prompt - a more common use of this command would be, for instance, as
   a side-effect of pressing a button on a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

                                    Warnings

   If the graphical interface doesn't periodically do an "update" of flush
   the pending I/O, then it may not be possible to interrupt a Soar agent
   from the command line.
