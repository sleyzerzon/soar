# Water Jug Tie Agent (Look-Ahead with State Evaluation) #

This agent is a modification of the [Water Jug Simple Agent](Agent_WJ_Simple.md) that demonstrates using a tie impasse to subgoal and evaluate operators.  This is an excellent demonstration of look-ahead search and how the selection default rules work.

Unlike the [Water Jug Look-Ahead Agent](Agent_WJ_LookAhead.md), the tie agent has knowledge that prefers certain moves over others, for example preferring a pour after a fill operator, so it is able to solve the problem much more efficiently.
