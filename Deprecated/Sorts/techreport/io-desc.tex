\subsection{The SORTS input-link}

There are five top-level attributes on the SORTS input link, "groups", "game-info", "feature-maps", "vision-info", and "query-results". The groups, feature-maps, and vision-info structures are all part of the main visual system (see section \ref{section:perception}), while game-info contains higher-level information about the game world, and query-results is used to communicate the results of specialized queries from Soar to the middleware.

The exact data structures of the input-link are located in tables \ref{tb:input-link} and \ref{tb:groups}.

\subsection{The SORTS output-link}
\label{sec:output-link}

The output-link allows the Soar agent to act in the game world by issuing commands to groups of friendly units, communicate directly to the middleware for actions such as querying,
and adjust the parameters of the visual subsystem in the middleware. All structures on the output link are similar- the Soar agent creates an output-link.command object with a name (\textbf{output-link.command.name}) specified. Depending on the command name, different parameters are needed. Parameters are attached to the command structure, as in \textbf{output-link.command.param0}. All legal commands and their necessary parameters are detailed in table \ref{tb:commands}.

look-at-location & $x,y$ & Move the focus of attention to the given coordinate (which must be in the current view window.\\
\hline
move-to-location & $x,y$ & Shift the view window to be centered at the given coordinate, and make that the focus of attention. \\
\hline
look-at-feature & $feature$, $sector$ & Move the focus of attention to a given feature in a given sector. The legal features are the names of the feature-map objects on the input link.\\
\hline
move-to-feature & $feature$, $sector$ & As above, but re-center the view window to the new location, also.\\
\hline
num-objects & $value$ & Change the maximum number of objects (groups) present on the input-link at once.\\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{\textbf{General middleware commands}}\\ 
\hline
locate-building & $building$, $x,y$, $distance$ & This command requests that the middleware attempt to find a location for a building of type $building$ approximately $distance$ units from the coordinate given. The resulting coordinate is returned through the query-result structure on the input-link. \\
\hline
increase-mineral-buffer & $value$ & Increase the mineral buffer by $value$ minerals.\\
\hline
clear-mineral-buffer & (none) & Set the mineral buffer to 0.\\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{\textbf{Group commands}}\\
\hline
move & $group0$, $param0$, $param1$ & Move the group with ID $group0$ to the x,y location where $param0$ is x and $param1$ is y, using the default precision of 10 (allow units to complete successfully if they are within 10 of the target).\\
\hline
move & $group0$, $param0$, $param1$, $param2$ & Move group $group0$ to the x,y location where $param0$ is x and $param1$ is y, using a precision of $param2$.\\
\hline
build & $group0$, $param0 .. param3$ & Use group $group0$ to build a building of type $param0$\footnote{Legal building types: 0=controlCenter, 1=barracks, 2=factory} at the x,y location given by $param1, param2$. If $param3$ is 1, the mineral buffer is used, otherwise it is not. \\
\hline
train & $group0$, $param0 .. param2$ & Use group $group0$ (a building) to train units of type $param1$\footnote{Legal unit types: 0=worker, 1=marine, 2=tank}. Train up to $param2$ units, and use the mineral buffer if $param3$ is 1. \\
\hline
attack & $group0$, $group1$ & Use the friendly group with ID $group0$ to attack $group1$.\\
\hline
mine & $group0$ & Assign $group0$ to mine minerals. The control center and mineral patch to use are automatically determined in the middleware. \\
\hline
stick & $group0$ & Set $group0$'s to be sticky- ensure it stays as one group, even if the members move apart. Assigning any of the above actions to a group does this by default. \\
\hline
free & $group0$ & Clear $group0$'s sticky status- allow the members to be split up and join other groups.\\
\hline
join &  $group0$, $group1$ & Force $group0$'s members to join $group1$. If $group1$ is not sticky, this may be automatically undone the next cycle.\\
