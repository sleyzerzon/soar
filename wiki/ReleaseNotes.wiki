Soar 9.3.3 Release Notes, June 2014
===================================

This release of Soar continues the 9.3 line. It includes the ability to
include search control knowledge into chunks, a new form of integrated
Tcl support, improved episodic and semantic memory and a large
assortment of bug fixes and user interface enhancements.  All learning
mechanisms are disabled by default.

Soar can be downloaded by following the download link on the Soar home
page at:

        http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

Soar releases include source code, demo programs, and a number of
applications that serve as examples of how to interface Soar to an
external environment.  There is support for integrating Soar with C++,
Java, Tcl and Python applications.  Many tools that aid in development
of Soar programs are also available.  The newly expanded download
section of the wiki allows you to browse and download all of the
different distributions, tools and agents.

Important Changes for 9.3.3
===========================

-------- 
Chunking 
--------

(1) Soar can now include search control knowledge in chunks.

This is done by keeping track of all *relevant* search control rules
that produced preferences that influenced the selection of the operator
that produced a result.  This set of preferences, called the
context-dependent preference set (CDPS), will be backtraced through,
possibly producing additional conditions in a chunk.  This setting is
off by default but can be enabled by 'learn --desirability-prefs' or
'learn -p'. This new feature can allow chunking to be used in situations
that would previously produce over-general chunks. See the Soar Manual
for more information.

---------------------------- 
Episodic and Semantic Memory
----------------------------

(1) Epmem search now uses less memory and computational resources.

(2) Default epmem storage trigger is now each decision cycle instead of
after output generation.

(3) Soar now uses a new schema for both databases.  This means old
databases can no longer be loaded.  A utility will soon be provided to
convert from the old schema to the new one.

(4) Users can now specify mathematical constraints to their smem
retrieval cues.  See the manual for more information.

(5) Both systems now have a new append-database setting that determines
whether Soar will erase the database when starting or re-initializing
via init-soar.

    - Databases are now closed upon init-soar.  With append-mode on,
    this will have no effect on memories.

    - Soar will now warn users that initializing Soar can clear their
    memories.  Only shown when changing epmem/smem settings such that
    they are storing to a file with append mode off.

    - Soar will now notify users that there was no change to epmem/smem
    memories when reinitializing if append mode is on.

(6) Both systems now handle database settings with more flexibility. 
Users may change path/database/append-database settings arbitrarily
until they get what they'd like.  It will not effect any changes until
you step Soar or do something that requires that memory system.

(7) Users can now switch from database to memory mode on the fly without
losing your data.  (The opposite will not work though.)

(8) Soar will now no longer automatically switch to database mode the
first time that you set the path.

(9) SMem and epmem now have options for --on, --off, -e, -d, --enable,
--disable parameters to epmem and smem to make interface consistent with
other systems.

(10) Soar now has an 'epmem --init' command.  This will close and
re-initialize the database like 'smem --init'.

-------------- 
User Interface 
--------------

(1) TclSoarLib

    - Soar now includes a dynamically loaded module that alters the Soar
    command line interface to allow you to use Tcl code on the command
    line and within your agent.  For example, users can use Tcl
    variables and functions directly within their soar code or make tcl
    function calls on the RHS of rules.

    - This mode is enabled via a new Soar command 'cli'.  For example,
    to load the new Tcl module, users can enter a 'cli tcl on' command,
    and Soar will look for a DLL in the same directory called TclSoarLib
    
    and load it if found.  Similarly, using an argument of Python will
    try to load PythonSoarLib, if it exists.  (which doesn't)

(2) Soar will now give feedback on many commands and errors that it did
not before.

(3) Soar will now give more informative messages to various command line
errors instead of just always saying "invalid attribute".

(4) Commands now display their settings using a consistent display theme
that should be much clearer.

---------------------- 
Reinforcement Learning 
----------------------

(1) Reinforcement learning now has a new trace mechanism to help users
understand why operators are selected.  When enabled, all proposed
operators at all goal levels will be recorded in the trace, along with
their names, other attribute-value pairs, and transition probabilities
derived from their numeric preferences. The format in which the trace is
printed is designed to be used by the program dot, which is part of the
Graphviz suite.  See the help entry for rl for more information.

(2) Reinforcement learning now has a new experimental delta-bar-delta
mode based on the work in Richard S. Sutton's paper "Adapting Bias by
Gradient Descent: An Incremental Version of Delta-Bar-Delta". Delta Bar
Delta is implemented in Soar RL as a decay mode. It changes the way all
the rules in the eligibility trace get their values updated. The key
idea is that the agent uses meta parameters to keep track of how much a
rule's RL value has been updated recently, and if a rule gets updates in
the same direction multiple times in a row then subsequent updates in
the same direction will have more effect. In some sense, DBD acts like
momentum for the learning rate.

(3) Users can now record a log file that contains every update to
productions' reinforcement learning values with the 'update-log-path'
setting.  For example, 'rl --set update-log-path rl_log.txt' would start
recording a log to the file rl_log.txt

(4) The Soar 'preferences' command now prints the actual probabilities
for operators based on the current selection method. Soar previously
always assumed softmax.

--------- 
Bug Fixes 
---------

(1) Fixed issue 105 in which a rule with an empty RHS caused a crash in
Soar.

(2) Fixed issue 127 Soar no longer inaccurately classifies certain rule
firings as operator proposals.  Instead of just looking for an attribute
named operator in a rhs action, it checks to see if that id element
points to a real state and hence is a real operator proposal.  If so, it
gives i-support to all of the rhs make actions of that rule firing.

(3) Fixed issue 130 in which Soar would exit with the error "Wanted to
create a GDS for a WME level different from the instantiation
level.....Big problems....exiting".

(4) Fixed issue 132 in which memory corruption could occur when wma and
epmem are both active.

(5) Fixed issue 133 in which extremely low decay rates caused Soar to
crash.

(6) Fixed bug that resulted in epmem recording breaking after init-soar.
 Soar will now properly close and re-initialize epmem.

(7) Fixed bug in epmem retrieval that could result in failed queries.

(8) Fixed bug in smem that caused Soar to crash when attempting to print
from smem after the settings pointing it to the correct database were
configured but before it was first used.  It will now connect to the
database before printing.

(9) Fixed a segfault in smem, triggered when a previously unhashed value
appeared in a neg-query.

(10) Fixed bug in which LTIs with i-supported children were not properly
forgotten.

(11) Fixed bug in cli that caused crashes on certain commands like an
empty echo command.

(12) Fixed bug in cli identifier printing shortcut. (You can againg type
"S1" to print S1 instead of print S1)

(13) Fixed bug in which data was not being written to epmem/smem
databases when using the cli.  It now shuts down and deletes kernel,
allowing proper clean-up.

(14) Fixed bug in which Python callbacks silently ignored exceptions.

(15) Fixed memory leak in Eaters when a wme is replaced.

(16) Fixed bug due to dubious logic in ParseXML that could cause working
memory to grow unnecessarily large.

(17) Fixed a bug in which very large messages could not be passed via an
SML filter callback.

------------------------- 
Building From Source Code
-------------------------

(1) The debug build is now the default.  Build script now uses --opt for
an optimized build instead of --dbg.

(2) Added option for static build (--static).

(3) Build script for iOS updated for latest version.

(4) Tcl SWIG interface updated and fully functional with latest version
of Soar and the latest version of ActiveTcl (8.6).

(5) Can now build C# SWIG wrappers.

(6) Building soar without single compilation units (--no-scu) now works
again.

(7) On OSX, build process now uses clang/clang++.

(8) Now has LSB support, which can facilitate compilation on certain
*nix system.

Other Changes in 9.3.3 
======================

-------------- 
User Interface 
--------------

(1) Soar has a new C-based command line interface for Soar that supports
multiple agents (called mcli).

    - Adds four new commands to manipulate agents: list, create, delete,
    switch

    - If more than one agent exists, the CLI will enter multi-agent
    mode, in which the CLI will print the output of all agents
    simulataneously, with each of their trace messages prefixed with the
    agent's color-coded name.
    
    - Caveats:  Currently color does not show up on windows machines. On
      linux and macs, colors are configured to look best on a dark
      background color.

(2) Preferences command will now indicate whether a WME has different
support at different levels, as well as whether the WME is linked to a
state but has no support there.

(3) When verbose mode is on, Soar will print the filename of each file
being sourced as it sources them.

(4) Soar now properly explains that a rule has bad RHS when it either it
creates a variable that is not tested in a positive condition on the LHS
(negative conditions don't count) or it passes an unbound variable to a
rhs function.

(5) The cli now prints the port used and what type of kernel it's
creating.

--------------- 
Episodic Memory 
---------------

(1) Soar now only prints out new king episode for an epmem search if a
new episode has actually been crowned king (considered best).

(2) Epmem search now uses most constraining values for ^before and
^after (smallest for before, largest for after)

(3) 'epmem --stats' now shows how many ^prev and ^retrieve commands have
been made

(4) Statistics for previous epmem queries once again available.

-------- 
Chunking 
--------

(1) The settings 'enable-through-local-negations' and
'disable-through-local-negations' have been renamed to be more succinct
and consistent with other settings.  They are now 'local-negations' and
'no-local-negations'.  The short version is still '-n' and '-N'.

(2) After changing chunking settings, Soar will give feedback of all
current settings.

--------- 
Bug Fixes 
---------

(1) Fixed bug that occurred when epmem is queried with an LTI, which was
promoted (stored into smem), in the middle of its most recent interval. 
Soar now sets the priority to its promotion time instead of the interval
start time.

(2) Fixed bug that resulted in epmem activation count not being properly
tracked.

(3) Fixed bug in epmem storage bug that would occur when it attempted to
recurse through a Y-shaped linkage between wme's.

(4) Fixed bug in smem where Soar would give users no feedback that
certain smem -add commands were bad (for example smem -add {fdsfds})

(5) Fixed working memory activation bug due to the fact that the test
for the o-support set of a WME is not sufficiently tight. In particular,
if one of the tested WMEs has i-support, but *that i-support is removed
at the same time as a rule that depends on it fires*, the result of that
rule will have that i-supported WME in it's o-set.

(6) Fixed bug in which a newline would not be printed when sourcing a
soar file in which a soar command is issued immediately after a
production is loaded in that same file.

(7) Fixed bug in default rules for A* search, when start == goal.  The
change here is that the total-estimated-cost should be updated when
estimated-cost != 0, and final-cost should be updated when
estimated-cost == 0. This is changed from the original code where the
total-estimated-cost is updated if path-cost != 0, which would fail if
start == goal, where path-cost == estimated-cost == total-estimated-cost
== final-cost == 0.  The change makes sense when you think about A* ()
when the estimated cost is 0, that means you've reached the desired
state, so the final cost is known.  Otherwise, the total cost is still
an estimate, so the final cost is not stated and it's only a total
*estimated* cost.

(8) Fixed bug with calls to output handlers that occurred when command
WMEs are deleted.

(9) Fixed some bugs that resulted in Soar not adding a new line when it
should have.  Handling of newlines is more consistent. (but still not
perfect.)

(10) Fixed bug in which Soar would not return an error message despite a
command's parameters being invalid.

(11) Fixed bug in Eaters and TankSoar when attempting to update an
output's status twice.

(12) Fixed bug caused by newline issues in jar manifest files. If a
manifest file doesn't have a terminating newline, certain system setups
will fail to read the last line, and the resulting jar file will be
missing that line.

(13) Fixed bug detecting correct python library on *nix platforms.

(14) Fixed compiling bugs because of inconsistent mac/windows/linux
linefeeds.

(15) Fixed compile error in GDS debug code.

------------------------- 
Building From Source Code
-------------------------

(1) Java SWIG source generation improved.

(2) Scons no longer traverse hidden directories looking for targets to
build

(3) Fixed bug in which scons was not properly rebuilding sml_java when
it should have.

(4) Scons will no longer try to build java targets when swig is not
installed

(5) Fixed bug in which it would not properly copy files into directories
that starts with a '.'

(6) Project/Solution generation for MS Visual Studio now works better

(7) Kernel now has doxygen setup files for automatic code help
generation

(8) Added --python option to scons for different python versions, which
takes a path to the python executable. Scons will then use it to
determine the appropriate python libraries for building the SML client.

------------ 
Code Changes 
------------ 
(This section is really only really relevant to people who modify or
interface 
to the source code.)

(1) Significant refactoring and reorganization of epmem/smem code for
clarity

(2) Migrated to new episodic memory and semantic memory database schemas

    - Designed to be much easier to understand.  Database relations are
    now strict.

    - Eliminated the temporal hash table.  Epmem will now look up
    constants from four symbol lookup tables instead.

    - In general, epmem is now more similar to smem database, and both
    use same schema versioning representation.

(3) Lots of new debugging facilities

    - SQL tracing

    - More debug messages in general

    - Many debug messages now print out things using the same function
    rather than an assortment of different ways (cout, printf,
    callbacks, etc.)

(4) Added new CLI utility functions to support more consistent printing

(5) Added new Soar Instance class that acts as a consistent hub across
various SML configurations. It is a singleton object that corresponds to
an instance of the soar dll, as opposed to an agent or kernel.  Added
initially to support the TclSoarLib dll, but could also be used for
other things as well.

(6) An internal output manager to simplify and consolidate the various
way that different portions of the Soar code produce output.  It also
allows us to re-direct output dynamically to other listeners (or
multiple ones), for example a database.

(7) Removed code for various experimental modes created by previous
graduate students.

(8) Scons updated and hacked to support Visual Studio 2013 until
official version does.

(9) CppUnit, PCRE removed.  STLSoft replaced with simpler timer
implementation.

(10) All support of obsolete unary parallel and binary parallel
preferences now removed

(11) TestSoarPerformance now has some #defines to allow you to set a
different test agent, change the number of trials and control the amount
of information printed.

Soar 9.3.2 Release Notes, April 2012
===================================

This release of Soar continues the 9.3 line which includes modules for
reinforcement learning (RL), episodic memory (EpMem), and semantic
memory (SMem), as well as everything from previous versions of Soar. It
includes a new "forgetting" mechanism, several bug fixes, a new
distribution
structure, and a simplification of how libraries are built in Soar.  All
learning mechanisms are disabled by default.

Soar can be downloaded from the Soar home page at:

        http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

Soar releases include source code, demo programs, and a number of
applications that serve as examples of how to interface Soar to an
external environment.  There is support for integrating Soar with C++,
Java, and Python applications.  Many tools that aid in development of
Soar programs are also available.  The newly expanded download section
of the wiki allows you to browse and download all of the different
distributions, tools and agents.

[Important Changes for 9.3.2]

Soar's build process has undergone significant modifications, and as a
result
several things have changed in the binary release:

1. Instead of separate libraries for ClientSML, ConnectionSML,
ElementXML,
KernelSML, and the Soar Kernel, there is now only a single Soar library.
On
Windows this is Soar.dll, on Linux libSoar.so, and on OSX libSoar.dylib.
This
means that when you are building SML clients, you only need to link to
that
single library. The SML header files have not changed: you still need to
include
sml_Client.h.

2. Due to the library merge, SML clients no longer have to locate the
KernelSML
library at run time. Therefore, all references to the location and name
of that
library, such as DefaultLibraryLocation, have been removed from the SML
API.
Specifically:
  - The set-library-location CLI command has been removed

  - The following functions have been removed:
      sml::Kernel::GetDefaultLibraryName
      sml::Kernel::GetLibraryLocation
      
  - The library location argument has been removed from the signatures
of the
following functions:
      sml::Agent::SpawnDebugger (see below)
      sml::Kernel::CreateKernelInCurrentThread
      
      sml::Kernel::CreateKernelInNewThread
      
      sml::Kernel::CreateEmbeddedConnection

3. The sml::Agent::SpawnDebugger function no longer uses the KernelSML
library
location to find SoarJavaDebugger.jar. Instead,
     1. If the path of the jar (not of the containing directory) is
provided as
an explicit argument, it is used.
     2. Otherwise, if SoarJavaDebugger.jar is in the current working
directory,
then that jar is used.
     2. Otherwise, if the environment variable SOAR_HOME is defined and
points
to the directory that contains SoarJavaDebugger.jar, then that jar is
used.
     3. Otherwise the search fails and the function returns false.
     
4. Due to the reduction in the number of files, we have merged the lib
directory
into the bin directory. The Soar library and the SWIG wrapper libraries
now
reside in the same directory as the executables. This makes life easier
for
Windows users running programs such as TestCLI or the Java debugger,
because
Windows searches the current directory for library dependencies by
default.

5. Linux and OSX users no longer need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the bin directory when running the native
executables in the distribution, such as TestCLI or TestSoarPerformance.
The
relative location of the library has been hard-coded into those
executables
using the rpath and install_name mechanisms in Linux and OSX,
respectively.
However, those environment variables must still be set for running the
java
debugger, as required by the JVM.

6. SoarSuite is now extremely streamlined.  It is intended for users
who want to either (1) just run Soar or (2) plug-in the latest version
of Soar into their current work.  It only contains the Soar kernel, the
Soar Java Debugger, Visual Soar, the Soar Manual, the default rules,
unit test programs and the Soar header files.

7. The Soar Tutorial now has its own download.  It contains the Soar
kernel,
the Java Debugger, Eaters, TankSoar, the Soar Manual, the Soar Tutorial,
VisualSoar, and all the introductory agents.

8. Nearly everything we provide now has stand-alone versions, including
TankSoar
and Eaters.  All agents, tools and environments now have their own wiki
pages
with thorough descriptions and individual downloads.  We highly
encourage
people to make their own work available on the Soar wiki.

9. The Soar SVN repository has went through major restructuring and
clean up
to support these changes.

10. When a tie impasse occurs, the substate is augmented with two new
WME
classes, which document operators that do not have numeric-indifferent
preferences associated with them. These augmentations are
"non-numeric" and "non-numeric-count" and operate analogously to the
existing "item" and "item-count" augmentations.

11. We have added a new forgetting mechanism to Soar to automatically
excise chunks via the base-level decay model. It is controlled via the
"rl" command using the "apoptosis" parameters. This functionality
helps develop learning agents that can persist for long periods of
time, accumulating a large amount of procedural knowledge while
bounding memory consumption. Version 9.3.1 of Soar included forgetting
of WMEs via the "wma" command, which served to bound procedural
matching and episodic reconstruction. WME forgetting worked well with
automatic semantic encoding via the "mirroring" parameter of the
"smem" command. Together, these forgetting policies facilitate the
development of long-living, learning agents that remain reactive in
real-time environments.

A more comprehensive list of changes is below.

DETAILED CHANGELIST
===================

The scons build process now works in Windows and is the preferred way to
build
Soar on all three supported platforms.

The old Visual Studio project and solution files have been removed from
the
distribution. Scons can generate those files to make it easier for
Windows users
to debug the kernel. Scons is now also included in all source
distributions to
simplify building Soar. 

Ant is no longer needed to build the Java debugger.

Soar-specific environment variables are no longer needed to compile Soar
on
Linux and OSX.

Improved documentation and completely restructured Soar web page and
wiki.
A lot of outdated information has been updated or removed.

Demo agents have been removed from the Java debugger and SoarSuite. They
are now
simply packaged in the Agents directory of the SoarTutorial.  They are
also
available for individual download.

New chapters have been added to the tutorial for episodic and semantic
memory.

VisualSoar has been removed from Soar core but can still be downloaded
from its
own wiki page.

SoarSuite now only includes the Soar kernel, the Soar Java Debugger,
Visual
Soar, the Soar Manual, the default rules, unit test programs and the
Soar
header files.

Added a new download specifically for the SoarTutorial.  It includes the
Soar kernel, the Java Debugger, Eaters, TankSoar, the Soar Manual, the
Soar Tutorial documents, VisualSoar, and all the introductory agents.

There are now stand-alone versions of TankSoar and Eaters.  They include
self-contained copies of the Soar kernel and the debugger and can be run
from
any directory.

A large variety of agents are now available for individual download. 
They
each have their own wiki page with a complete description.

Default rules updated for Soar 9.

Soar now works with the OpenJava JDK, which is what is installed by
default on
Ubuntu linux.

All releases for the various platforms now have identical naming and
directory
structures.  This should make things much more consistent and less
brittle.

Issue 78: The selection probabilities outputted by the "pref" command
now
make sense for all exploration strategies, not just softmax.

Issue 92: Removed the "run forever" command. "run" without any arguments
will
achieve teh same thing.

Issue 93: Alias command now adheres to the documentation.  First
argument is
once again the alias name.

Issue 95: Certain types of comments on the RHS of productions no longer
produces an error in the parser.

Issue 98: Soar will no longer automatically change the
indifference-selection
policy to episilon-greedy when turning reinforcement learning on.  This
may
break the expected behavior of some agents, so users should make sure to
set
the policy the want explicitly.  All of the agents in our repository
have been
updated to explicitly set it to epsilon-greedy after they turn RL on.

Issue 98: To increase performance, Soar will no longer discount updates
over
subgoals as though they were gaps, i.e. HRL-Discount is now off by
default.

Issue 98: By default, Soar will no longer create a chunk that only
differs
from another rule in the value of the numeric indifferent preference,
i.e.
Chunk-Stop is now on by default.

Issue 102: CLI now strips out comments at the end of the line properly.

Issue 103: Watch-wmes command now works again.  You can now set up
arbitrary
filters on which wmes are printed out.

[Important Changes for 9.3.1]

Inequality comparisons on string constants and identifiers are now
evaluated lexically rather than always returning false. Watch out--we
found that this changed the behavior on some agents that relied on the
old, broken behavior.

Improvements in stability and performance for the learning modules that
rely on databases (EpMem and SMem). Sqlite, the backing database, has
been upgraded to 3.7.4. Database schemas have been changed breaking
backwards compatibility.

The Soar kernel and SML interface now uses 64-bit integers for things
like WME values, timetags, stats, counters, and rete data structures.
Motivation for these changes is current research involving long-running
agents that were rolling over 32-bit integers in some instances. The
client interface is mostly backwards compatible but some errors or
warnings (because of loss of precision) may be encountered.

Working memory activation based forgetting is now stable and
efficient. However, parameters controlling its behavior are still
under experimentation and will likely change in the future.

The command line interface has been updated to behave much more like it
behaved before 8.6.0. The parsing is simplified and follows most of the
rules of the Tcl language and its behavior is now much easier to
validate (and many tests have been added). This should be mostly
transparent to the end user. 

The help command now displays command documentation text directly
in the terminal again, similar to the pre-9.0 behavior. The help
text can now be automatically pulled from the wiki pages, making
it much easier to keep up to date. See Core/CLI/gen_cli_help.sh for
more details.

The Soar manual has been revised significantly. New sections
describing reinforcement learning, episodic memory, and semantic
memory have been added, and other sections have been updated to
reflect recent kernel changes.

A more comprehensive list of changes is below.

Prerequisites
=============

[Platforms]

Officially supported platforms are:

  * Windows XP (32 bit), Vista & 7 32/64 bit
  * Ubuntu Linux 10/11 32/64 bit
  * Mac OS X 10.6 64 bit

Other platforms may work but have not specifically been tested, you can
try binaries or compile from source:

        http://code.google.com/p/soar/wiki/Build

Due to path length limits on some versions of Windows, you may need to
extract Soar to C:\ -- watch for errors during the extraction process.
        
[Java]

Java is required to use the Java applications distributed with Soar,
including the debugger. Java must be available in the path. Some
operating systems already have Java installed, but be aware that we only
develop and test our applications using the Sun Java runtime environment
6 and other JVMs (such as GCJ) may not work:

   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT 64-BIT BINARIES: 32-bit Java virtual machines
cannot load 64-bit shared libraries. Please download appropriate
binaries for your installed virtual machine. Attempting to open tools
such as the Soar Java Debugger with the wrong JVM can cause the java
process to hang on Windows (use task manager to terminate it).

OS X USERS CAN CHECK/SELECT WHAT JVM THEY ARE USING WITH A UTILITY: Use
spotlight or look for the utility application "Java Preferences". More
information:

        http://developer.apple.com/java/faq/

[Python]

The included Python libraries support Python versions 2.6.  Your
installed Python architecture (32- or 64-bit) must be the same as the
binaries you download.

DETAILED CHANGELIST
===================

Bugfixes
--------

Issue 65: chunks being built despite justifications in backtrace when
creating result on super-superstate.

Issue 70: Weird printing for strings that look like identifiers

Issue 75: Incorrect id printed in GDS removal messages

Issue 77: Lots of duplicate code in sml_KernelHelpers.cpp

Issue 79: Print command now works as documented.

GDS trace output now reports state number instead of internal level.

Connecting to a remote kernel via process number overflows a short.

Major performance fix in semantic memory when validating long-term
identifiers on rules with lots of actions.

vsnprintf_with_symbols was not null-terminating strings converted from
ids causing overruns.

Client SML identifier symbol bug fixed that was causing crashes
(r12087).

Crash caused by disabling output link change tracking.

Memory leak caused during chunking (r12151).

GDS issue where multiple references to removed states weren't all
getting cleared.

Segfault when storing a wme in epmem whose value was an identifier and
id a long-term identifier that had never been stored in epmem.

Segfault that would occur when a wme is added and removed in the same
phase

Major bugfix in interaction between epmem and smem.  (r12411)

WMA bug wherein preferences in an i-supported wme's cached o-set were
getting deallocated.

Code cleanup and maintenance fixes throughout the code.


Episodic & Semantic Memory Changes
----------------------------------

Semantic and episodic memory retrievals can now produce chunks as
opposed to only justifications.

Various experimental activation behaviors added to semantic memory.
Activation is now represented as a real number.  As a result, the
database schema was changed, breaking backwards compatibility.  A
frequency-based activation mode is introduced.

An experimental merge parameter added to semantic and episodic
memories allowing modification of long-term identifiers in working
memory.

An experimental parameter added to episodic memory that controls how
cue wmes are ordered during graph matching.


Command Line Interface Changes
------------------------------

-g/--gds flag added to the watch command for watching only GDS
messages.

Printing productions with print command now displays name of file
production was sourced from.

It is now possible to disable per-cycle stat tracking.

-d flag added to stat which makes it print only the current decision
count.

The TestCLI program has been rewritten, is much cleaner and a good
example of a lightweight debugger.

Added check to prevent crash when disconnecting Java debugger from
remote Soar when not connected.

Added new max-dc-time command to interrupt kernel execution after a
long decision cycle.


New SML Applications
--------------------

RLCLI: a simple debugger for RL experiments.

SoarQNA: facilitates agent access to external knowledge stores via the
IO system.

Liar's Dice probability calculator.


Miscellaneous Changes
---------------------

Visual Studio 2010 migration started, not officially supported yet.

New features and fixes in SMLJava library.

Experimental JMX API interface added for debugger for Soar IDE
integration.  Not officially supported.

Support for swig 2 added.

Build procedure cleanup, some stuff wasn't getting built or cleaned
correctly.  Some issues still exist but can be worked around by make
clean && make.

Jars all target Java 1.5 for better compatibility.

Output-link change tracking is now disabled by default until the
output-link identifier is requested unless the user explicitly enables
it.

GDS stats added to stats xml output.

Lots of changes to stats reporting especially with respect to timers
and time per decision cycle.  Precision increased in many places.
Configurable at runtime using timers command.

Experimental support to discard learned chunks that are duplicates of
existing RL rules modulo numeric preference value.

= 9.3.0 =
<pre>Soar 9.3.0 Release Notes, March, 2010
=====================================

This release of Soar includes modules for reinforcement learning
(introduced in 9.0), episodic memory (introduced in 9.1), and semantic
memory (introduced in 9.2), along with many new features and stability
updates. All learning mechanisms are now disabled by default.

Soar can be downloaded from the Soar home page at:

	http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

Soar releases include source code, demo programs, and a number of
applications that serve as examples of how to interface Soar to an
external
environment.  There is support for integrating Soar with C++, Java, and
Python applications.  Many tools that aid in development of Soar
programs
are also included.

[Reinforcement Learning (RL)]

RL is the architectural integration of reinforcement learning with Soar.
The RL mechanism will automatically tune the values of
numeric-indifferent
preference rules based on reward generated while a Soar agent executes.
These values represent the expected discounted sum of future rewards the
agent will receive if it selects that operator for states matched by the
condition of the rule. See the RL manual and tutorial in Documentation.

To see RL in action right away, try the Water Jug RL demo (it can be
loaded
from the Demos->Water Jug menu in the Java Debugger). To see the effects
of
RL, run it to completion, then init-soar and run it again.  Repeat 4-5
times to see it reach optimal behavior. (Note: the agent may
occasionally
perform non-optimal behavior even after it has converged because of its
exploration policy. See the RL manual and tutorial for details).

[Episodic Memory (EpMem)]

EpMem is a task-independent, architectural integration of an artificial
episodic memory with Soar. The EpMem mechanism will automatically record
episodes as a Soar agent executes. These episodes can later be queried
and
retrieved in order to improve performance on future tasks. See the EpMem
manual for details.

[Semantic Memory (SMem)]

SMem is a task-independent, architectural integration of an artificial
semantic memory with Soar. The SMem mechanism facilitates deliberate
recording and querying of semantic chunks as a Soar agent executes.

[Help and Contact information]

Please do not hesitate to contact the Soar group by sending mail to:

	For general Soar-related discussion and announcements:
		soar-group@lists.sourceforge.net
	
	For more technical developer discussion:
		soar-sml-list@lists.sourceforge.net

Please do not hesitate to file bugs on our issue tracker (search for
duplicates first):

	http://code.google.com/p/soar/issues/list	

[Important Changes]

There have been performance, correctness, and stability improvements
across
the board, especially with the learning mechanisms, which are all
disabled
by default.

Long-term identifiers are now integrated in all symbolic memory systems.
More information on long-term identifiers can be found in section 4.2 of
the Soar-SMem manual in the documentation folder.

The allocate command has been added to Soar to allow agents to set aside
memory before starting a run so that the cost of allocation is not
incurred
during the run.

The probability of selection for proposed operators is now included in
the
preferences command output, helpful for debugging agents using
indifferent
selection or RL, or agents that have complex operator preference
semantics.

SML tracks changes on the Soar output-link in order for a number of
useful
functions to perform correctly. This change tracking comes at a cost and
may now be disabled for a significant increase in performance -- even
for
agents that do not use the output-link. See the new output link guide
for
more information ("Examine in Detail" is the only option when disabling
change tracking):

	http://code.google.com/p/soar/wiki/SMLOutputLinkGuide

SML often opens ports when a Kernel is created. This behavior has been
extended so that it can bind to any available port, and to use local
sockets or local pipes with names based on the process id, fixing a lot
of
issues people were having. Complete documentation is included in the
ClientKernel header file.

A more comprehensive list of changes is below.

Changes for 9.3.0
=================

We have moved some of our development hosting over to Google Code,
including the wiki and issue tracker. Please check it out at

	http://soar.googlecode.com

Much more documentation and example code is on the Google Code wiki.

A new "smem --init" command has been introduced for reinitialization of
all
symbolic memory systems.

RL: Greatly improved template performance.

RL: Added ability to disable hierarchical discounting.

Working Memory Activation (WMA): Rewritten from scratch for performance
(no
more ring) and correctness (including no more need for top-level ref
counts), many fewer parameters.

WMA: Printing working memory with the "internal" flag shows activation
value.

EpMem: Added ability to output visualization of episodes in Graphviz.

Epmem: Removal of lots of legacy code (including "tree" mode).

Epmem: Status WME (success/failure) refers to the initiating command.

SMem: Added ability to output visualization of semantic store in
Graphviz.

SMem: Storage occurs at the end of every phase.

SMem: Greatly improved retrieval performance.

SMem: Status WME (success/failure) refers to the initiating command.

The build procedure has changed dramatically and is detailed on the
Google
Code wiki.

Issue 31: Kernel timers for performance tuning have been updated to use
code from stlsoft.org, addressing many timer issues.

Issue 16: rand command and rand rhs functions implemented. This was
erroneously included in the previous release's change log.

Issue 60, 42: Invalid select command crash, other select command fixes.

Issue 61: Non-single compiliation units work now.

Issue 57: Many changes related to output-link change tracking including
a
new method to disable output-link change tracking for a significant
performance increase if not using specific SML methods. See Wiki:
SMLOutputLinkGuide and method documentation for ClientAgent for much
more
information.

Issue 62: KernelSML is no longer a singleton per process. Multiple
Kernels
can now be created (and deleted) which have distinct sets of agents.

Issue 59: Added an RL parameter to turn off discounting during gaps.

Issue 53: Capture input string quoting problem fixed.

Issue 27: Listener port semantics extended to allow random listener
ports
and process-specific local sockets/pipes.

Issue 40: Java Debugger layout file issues.

Issue 51: Run command extended with a new option to interrupt when a
goal
retracts.

Issue 39: Memory leaks fixed.

Issue 36: Increased callback performance in SML (affects agents not
using
any callbacks).

Issue 7: Memory pool preallocation command added.

Issue 18: preferences command extended to include probability that
current
operators may be selected.

= 9.2.0 =
<pre>Soar 9.0.1, 9.1.1, 9.2.0 Release Notes
======================================

This release of Soar continues the 9.x series of releases during which
we
expect to introduce several new mechanisms. 

Soar can be downloaded from the Soar homepage at:

        http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

These Soar releases include all source code, many demo programs, and a
number
of applications that serve as examples of how to interface Soar to an
external
environment.  There is support for integrating Soar with C++, Java, Tcl,
Python
and C# applications.  Many tools that aid in development of Soar
programs are
also included.

Soar 9.0.1 (Soar-RL)
====================

Soar 9.0 includes reinforcement learning code (Soar-RL), which was first
released alongside the 8.6.4 beta. Soar 9.0.1 is primarily a maintenance
release, although many bugs have been fixed and minor features added.

Soar-RL is the architectural integration of reinforcement learning (RL)
with
Soar. The RL mechanism will automatically tune the values of
numeric-indifferent preference rules based on reward generated while a
Soar
agent executes.  These values represent the expected discounted sum of
future
rewards the agent will receive if it selects that operator for states
matched
by the condition of the rule.  See the RL manual and tutorial in
Documentation.

To see Soar-RL in action right away, try the Water Jug RL demo (it can
be
loaded from the Demos->Water Jug menu in the Java Debugger). To see the
effects
of RL, run it to completion, then init-soar and run it again. Repeat 4-5
times
to see it reach optimal behavior. (Note: the agent may occasionally
perform
non-optimal behavior even after it has converged because of its
exploration
policy. See the RL manual and tutorial for details).

Soar 9.1.1 (Episodic Memory)
============================

Soar 9.1 includes an Episodic Memory module, which was first released as
Soar
9.1.0.  Soar 9.1.1 is primarily a maintenance release with bugs fixed
and minor
features added. 9.1 also includes all of the features from 9.0
(Soar-RL).

Soar-EpMem is a task-independent, architectural integration of an
artificial
episodic memory (EpMem) with Soar.  The EpMem mechanism will
automatically
record episodes as a Soar agent executes.  These episodes can later be
queried
and retrieved in order to improve performance on future tasks. See the
EpMem
manual for details.

Soar 9.2.0 (Semantic Memory)
============================

Soar 9.2 includes a Semantic Memory module, and this release of Soar
9.2.0 is
the first official release of Soar with semantic memory capabilities.
9.2 also
includes all features from 9.1 (EpMem) and 9.0 (Soar-RL).

Soar-SMem is a task-independent, architectural integration of an
artificial
semantic memory (SMem) with Soar.  The SMem mechanism facilitates
deliberate
recording and querying of semantic chunks as a Soar agent executes.

Installation Requirements
=========================

These releases are generated for Windows, Linux, and OSX systems. 
Windows XP
and Vista are supported, as well as 32- and 64-bit architectures.

* IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT 64-BIT BINARIES: To use the 64-bit Soar tools
with Java
  (such as the Java debugger) you must be using the 64-bit JVM.
Attempting to
  start 64-bit Soar programs with the 32-bit JVM on Windows will cause a
  javaw.exe process to hang open (terminate it using task manager). Also
note:
  attempting to start 32-bit Java tools, such as those included in
previous
  distributions of Soar, with a 64-bit JVM will also result in the
hanging
  javaw.exe process.

* Sun Java 1.5 or newer is required to use the Java applications,
including the
  debugger (Java must be available in the path). Get it at
  http://java.sun.com/. Most operating systems probably already have
Java
  installed. NOTE: Java 1.4.2 is no longer supported.

* The Soar Suite needs under 100 MB for regular use, but closer to 1 GB
of disk
  space for object and debugging files if rebuilding all projects.

* Due to path length limits on some versions of Windows, it is
recommended
  to extract Soar to the C:\ root or similar. Some parts of the Soar
Suite
  directory structure are deep, so users wishing to put Soar in a deep
location
  on their machines (such as 
  C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\Visual Studio
Projects) may 
  run into issues.

* Tcl version 8.4 is required for the Tcl SML interface. Threaded Tcl
builds
  are not supported. Windows 64-bit does not include the Tcl SML
interface.
  Your installed Tcl architecture must be the same (32 or 64 bit) as the
Soar
  binaries for the Tcl SML interface to load correctly.

* The included Python libraries support Python 2.5.  Python 2.6 and 3
support
  requires a rebuild of the ClientSMLPython project. Your installed
Python
  architecture must be the same (32 or 64 bit) as the Soar binaries for
the 
  Python SML interface to load correctly.

Build Requirements
==================

Binaries are released for Windows/Linux/OS X, so building is not
required.  For
those on other platforms or developers:

* Compilers: Windows: Visual Studio 2005 SP1 or 2008, Linux/OS X: GCC
3.3 
  or later

* SWIG 1.3.31 or later is required to build with cross-language support
(e.g.
  to use the Java debugger).

* Apache ant is required to build Java projects.

* Only the Sun JDK will work, 1.5 or newer.

* On Linux/OS X: Scons, Python 2.5 or newer, Tcl 8.4

* Please see detailed build instructions available on http://msoar.org

New in 9.0.1, 9.1.1, 9.2.0
==========================

* Native 64-bit platform support for Windows, Linux, OSX (bugs 1139, 
  1064, 1036, 531) resulting in different, usually better performance
  on these platforms, and definite ease of compilation and integration
  with tools such as Java and Python.

* Visual Studio 2008 is now supported and its use is recommended. 
  Visual Studio 2005 support will likely be dropped with the next
  release.

* Soar 7 mode has been completely removed.

* Preference semantics regarding the generation of operator conflict
  impasses have changed, see appendix D in the Soar Manual for details.

* Apache ant is now used to build java projects. This results in much
  faster and reliable Java builds.

Detailed fixes:

* Bug 873: Match-time interrupt with :interrupt production tag re-
enabled. 

* Bug 234: Preference semantics changed regarding operator conflicts.

* Bug 1145: dont-learn/force-learn RHS actions fixed.

* Bug 1144: Crash bug related to chunking caveat mentioned in manual
section
  4.6.5 fixed, helpful error message displayed instead.

* Bug 1011: Impasses that existed in a superstate were not getting
regenerated
  if the sub-state was removed due to the GDS, this has been fixed.

* Bug 878: With verbose enabled, the general reason states are getting
removed
  is printed when the state is removed.

* Bug 510: Chunking bug fixed when trying to chunk over negated,
conjuntive
  conditions.

* Bug 1121: RL template production (:template) bug fixed that was
failing to
  correctly generate productions if variables starting with "o" were
used.

* Bug 882: Changing trace filters in the Soar Java Debugger no longer
collapses
  the whole trace.

* Bug 1143: Direct I/O functions for WMEs in SML were acting in the
wrong phase
  (usually the output phase instead of the input phase), changed these
  functions to instead buffer their actions for later execution in the
input
  phase.

* Bug 866: Optimization settings with Visual Studio tweaked.

* Bug 517: Fixed a bug where an unbound variable included in a negated
  condition where a bound variable was required would crash Soar.

* Bug 1138: Fixed FindByAttribute bug not handling piped strings
correctly and,
  as a result, made it impossible to find some WMEs created on the
kernel side.

* Bug 867: Extended SML Identifier interface adding a number of methods
that
  don't have the redundant Agent pointer in their argument list.

* Bug 1049: Fixed io_header_output memory leak.

* Bug 1060: CreateSharedIdWME now explicitly fails if an existing WME is
  specified, violating the working memory set restriction.

* Bug 987, 1013: Echo command now ignores braces, pipes and other Soar
  characters so that better ascii art is possible.

* Bug 1084, 1124, 1141: gp command extended with better error messages,
maximum
  rule threshold, VisualSoar support, newline indifference.

* Bug 1057: Many buffers replaced with growable, safer containers such
as
  std::string and std::stringstream in performance-indifferent code.

* Bug 776: New random command implemented and random right hand side
functions
  implemented for random numbers on command.

* Bug 1106: New print --exact flag added to avoid printing unnecessary
copies
  of objects with multi-valued attributes. 

* Bug 927: Command line interface made more reentrant to avoid weird
"true"
  results output with multiple clients connected to the agent.

* Bug 952: New agents can now be created on the fly, during a run.

* Bug 1104: Fixed TestCLI hang if exited during run.

* Bug 1033: CreateKernelInNewThread error message fixed.

* Bug 794: edit-production now reports failure if visual soar is not
connected.

* Bug 1043: Added SML Agent methods to launch the debugger.

* Bug 1140: RHS halt does not cancel multiple Soar2D runs.

* Bug 1099: Find function in Soar Java Debugger scrolls window to result
now.

* Bug 638: Tutorials updated.

* Bug 931: Multiple productions can be pasted in to debugger at same
time now.

* Bug 1012: Unterminated strings in productions fail at parse-time now.

* Bug 1025: GetOutputLink() no longer returns null.

* Bug 1042: Debugger command line options fixed.

* Bug 1045: Status complete was getting added twice on output link
commands.

* Bug 1056: Kernel changed to use const char more.

* Bug 627: Help command lists folder instead of using command-names
file,
  allowing arbitrary help topics to be easily added.

* Bug 1105: Capture/replay input implemented.

* Large Soar production file parsing speed improvements.

* Soar2d rewritten, faster, easier to configure.

* Various memory leaks fixed, some major.

* Tcl version 8.4 is required for the Tcl SML interface. Threaded Tcl
builds
  are not supported. Windows 64-bit does not include the Tcl SML
interface.
  Your installed Tcl architecture must be the same (32 or 64 bit) as the
Soar
  binaries for the Tcl SML interface to load correctly.

* The included Python libraries support Python 2.5.  Python 2.6 and 3
support
  requires a rebuild of the ClientSMLPython project. Your installed
Python
  architecture must be the same (32 or 64 bit) as the Soar binaries for
the 
  Python SML interface to load correctly.

Build Requirements
==================

Binaries are released for Windows/Linux/OS X, so building is not
required.  For
those on other platforms or developers:

* Compilers: Windows: Visual Studio 2005 SP1 or 2008, Linux/OS X: GCC
3.3 
  or later

* SWIG 1.3.31 or later is required to build with cross-language support
(e.g.
  to use the Java debugger).

* Apache ant is required to build Java projects.

* Only the Sun JDK will work, 1.5 or newer.

* On Linux/OS X: Scons, Python 2.5 or newer, Tcl 8.4

* Please see detailed build instructions available on http://msoar.org

New in 9.0.1, 9.1.1, 9.2.0
==========================

* Native 64-bit platform support for Windows, Linux, OSX (bugs 1139, 
  1064, 1036, 531) resulting in different, usually better performance
  on these platforms, and definite ease of compilation and integration
  with tools such as Java and Python.

* Visual Studio 2008 is now supported and its use is recommended. 
  Visual Studio 2005 support will likely be dropped with the next
  release.

* Soar 7 mode has been completely removed.

* Preference semantics regarding the generation of operator conflict
  impasses have changed, see appendix D in the Soar Manual for details.

* Apache ant is now used to build java projects. This results in much
  faster and reliable Java builds.

Detailed fixes:

* Bug 873: Match-time interrupt with :interrupt production tag re-
enabled. 

* Bug 234: Preference semantics changed regarding operator conflicts.

* Bug 1145: dont-learn/force-learn RHS actions fixed.

* Bug 1144: Crash bug related to chunking caveat mentioned in manual
section
  4.6.5 fixed, helpful error message displayed instead.

* Bug 1011: Impasses that existed in a superstate were not getting
regenerated
  if the sub-state was removed due to the GDS, this has been fixed.

* Bug 878: With verbose enabled, the general reason states are getting
removed
  is printed when the state is removed.

* Bug 510: Chunking bug fixed when trying to chunk over negated,
conjuntive
  conditions.

* Bug 1121: RL template production (:template) bug fixed that was
failing to
  correctly generate productions if variables starting with "o" were
used.

* Bug 882: Changing trace filters in the Soar Java Debugger no longer
collapses
  the whole trace.

* Bug 1143: Direct I/O functions for WMEs in SML were acting in the
wrong phase
  (usually the output phase instead of the input phase), changed these
  functions to instead buffer their actions for later execution in the
input
  phase.

* Bug 866: Optimization settings with Visual Studio tweaked.

* Bug 517: Fixed a bug where an unbound variable included in a negated
  condition where a bound variable was required would crash Soar.

* Bug 1138: Fixed FindByAttribute bug not handling piped strings
correctly and,
  as a result, made it impossible to find some WMEs created on the
kernel side.

* Bug 867: Extended SML Identifier interface adding a number of methods
that
  don't have the redundant Agent pointer in their argument list.

* Bug 1049: Fixed io_header_output memory leak.

* Bug 1060: CreateSharedIdWME now explicitly fails if an existing WME is
  specified, violating the working memory set restriction.

* Bug 987, 1013: Echo command now ignores braces, pipes and other Soar
  characters so that better ascii art is possible.

* Bug 1084, 1124, 1141: gp command extended with better error messages,
maximum
  rule threshold, VisualSoar support, newline indifference.

as
  std::string and std::stringstream in performance-indifferent code.

* Bug 776: New random command implemented and random right hand side
functions
  implemented for random numbers on command.

* Bug 1106: New print --exact flag added to avoid printing unnecessary
copies
  of objects with multi-valued attributes.

"true"
  results output with multiple clients connected to the agent.

* Bug 952: New agents can now be created on the fly, during a run.

* Bug 1104: Fixed TestCLI hang if exited during run.

* Bug 1033: CreateKernelInNewThread error message fixed.

* Bug 794: edit-production now reports failure if visual soar is not
connected.

* Bug 1043: Added SML Agent methods to launch the debugger.

* Bug 1140: RHS halt does not cancel multiple Soar2D runs.

* Bug 1099: Find function in Soar Java Debugger scrolls window to result
now.

= 9.1.0 =
<pre>Soar 9.1.0-beta Release Notes
=============================

This release of Soar continues the 9.x series of releases during which
we 
expect to introduce several new mechanisms. 9.0.0 included reinforcement
learning code (Soar-RL), which was first released alongside the 8.6.4
beta. 9.0.0 was also the first release to include the SML interface 
without gSKI.  9.1.0-beta includes episodic memory (Soar-EpMem) and
Working
Memory Activation (WMA).

Soar-EpMem is a task-independent, architectural integration of an
artificial 
episodic memory (EpMem) with Soar.  The EpMem mechanism will
automatically 
record episodes as a Soar agent executes.  These episodes can later be
queried 
and retrieved in order to improve performance on future tasks.  See the
EpMem 
manual in Documentation.

This release of Soar-EpMem does not include a tutorial.  To see examples
of using Soar-EpMem with a Soar agent, see the "kb" agent in the Demos
directory.  This agent will run a series of EpMem "unit tests,"
exploring
all forms of the Soar-EpMem agent API.

Soar 9.1.0-beta includes all source code, many demo programs, and a 
number of applications that serve as examples of how to interface 
Soar to an external Environment.  There is support for integrating 
Soar with C++, Java, Tcl, Python and C# applications.  Many Tools
that aid in development of Soar programs are also included.

These Release Notes describe the primary changes in this 
latest release.  More detailed information can be obtained at 
http://winter.eecs.umich.edu/soarwiki

This release was generated for Windows, Linux, and OSX systems.  
Windows XP and Vista are supported.

Soar 9.1.0-beta can be downloaded from the Soar homepage at:

        http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

Installation Requirements
=========================

* On Windows, the 19MB download file expands to ~45MB when extracted.  
  Linux and OSX disk requirements are similar. Note that Windows has
  a 255 character path length limit; some parts of the directory 
  structure are deep, so users wishing to put Soar in a deep location
  on their machines may run into issues.

* Java 1.5.0 or newer is required to use the Java applications,
  including the debugger (Java must be available in the path). Get it 
  at http://java.sun.com/. Most operating systems probably already have 
  Java installed. NOTE: Java 1.4.2 is no longer supported.

* If you want to run Tcl applications on Linux, Tcl 8.4.x or later is
  required (note that the tutorial applications are now available in
  Java).  Also note that we do not currently support threaded builds
  of Tcl (e.g. ActiveTcl 8.4.11.2 or later).

* The included Python libraries support Python 2.4.  Python 2.5 support
  requires a rebuild of the ClientSMLPython project.

Build Requirements
==================
Binaries are released for Windows/Linux/OS X, so building is not
required.
For those on other platforms or developers:
* On all platforms, SWIG 1.3.31 or later is required to build with 
  cross-language support (e.g. to use the Java debugger).
* On Windows, Visual Studio 2005 SP1 is required.
* On Linux/Unix/OS X, Python, SCons, gcc 3.3 or later required.

Soar-EpMem & SQLite
===================
Soar-EpMem requires both statically and dynamically linked SQLite
components. 
The former is provided in source. The latter, at this time, is a manual
process 
(SQLite uses make scripts for their compile). EpMem includes pre-built
binaries 
for Windows, Linux (tested on Ubuntu) and OS X Leopard. If your install
works with 
these components, you can skip this section. Otherwise, the following
process 
documents how to build the required components.

First, download the source tarball from the SQLite homepage
(http://www.sqlite.org/download.html). 
To be clear, you want the non-amalgamated source code tarball 
(probably named sqlite-A.B.C.tar.gz, for version A.B.C).  Next, extract
the contents, 
change to the directory, and run ./configure followed by make at the
command line. 
These commands will create the required libraries for your system.  The
final step 
is to copy the required components from the SQLite directory to your
EpMem 
directory. The only file of interest is named libsqliteA.B.C.D.ext 
(ext is dylib on Mac, so for Linux; A.B.C.D will vary on the version)
and is 
located in the .libs folder of your SQLite directory. You will want to
copy this 
file out of .libs and into the SoarLibrary/lib folder of your EpMem
install. 
Furthermore, SQLite requires that this file exist under two additional
names: 
libqsliteA.ext and libsqliteA.B.ext. To accommodate, you can either
create a symbolic 
link under these two names or duplicate the file (it makes no
difference, except 
for added/saved disk space).  Once you have these components in the
appropriate directory, 
your EpMem build (and subsequent runs) should work fine.

Components of Soar 9.1.0-beta
=============================
* Pre-built libraries and executables (SoarLibrary/bin)
* all source code, config files, and OS tools for automated Soar builds
* SoarJavaDebugger 
* VisualSoar
* JavaEaters, JavaTankSoar, TclEaters
* Test and Demo programs
* Documentation

New in 9.1.0-beta
=================

* Components and Capabilities added
  -- EpMem commands and documentation added (see EpMem manual in
     Documentation directory).
  -- WMA commands and documentation added (see EpMem manual in
     Documentation directory).
  -- Other minor enhancements.

* Bug fixes
  -- Several other minor fixes.

Known issues:
=============

* No EpMem tutorial
* EpMem "provenance" parameter is unimplemented
* ^status complete appears on the ^output-link immediately instead 
  of during the next input phase.
* The Soar 7 mode implementation currently relies on an ugly hack. If
  you experience problems in this mode, please let us know.
* Many other minor issues (see bugzilla for details).

= 9.0.1 =
<pre>Soar 9.0.1, 9.1.1, 9.2.0 Release Notes
======================================

This release of Soar continues the 9.x series of releases during which
we
expect to introduce several new mechanisms. 

Soar can be downloaded from the Soar homepage at:

        http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

These Soar releases include all source code, many demo programs, and a
number
of applications that serve as examples of how to interface Soar to an
external
environment.  There is support for integrating Soar with C++, Java, Tcl,
Python
and C# applications.  Many tools that aid in development of Soar
programs are
also included.

Soar 9.0.1 (Soar-RL)
====================

Soar 9.0 includes reinforcement learning code (Soar-RL), which was first
released alongside the 8.6.4 beta. Soar 9.0.1 is primarily a maintenance
release, although many bugs have been fixed and minor features added.

Soar-RL is the architectural integration of reinforcement learning (RL)
with
Soar. The RL mechanism will automatically tune the values of
numeric-indifferent preference rules based on reward generated while a
Soar
agent executes.  These values represent the expected discounted sum of
future
rewards the agent will receive if it selects that operator for states
matched
by the condition of the rule.  See the RL manual and tutorial in
Documentation.

To see Soar-RL in action right away, try the Water Jug RL demo (it can
be
loaded from the Demos->Water Jug menu in the Java Debugger). To see the
effects
of RL, run it to completion, then init-soar and run it again. Repeat 4-5
times
to see it reach optimal behavior. (Note: the agent may occasionally
perform
non-optimal behavior even after it has converged because of its
exploration
policy. See the RL manual and tutorial for details).

Soar 9.1.1 (Episodic Memory)
============================

Soar 9.1 includes an Episodic Memory module, which was first released as
Soar
9.1.0.  Soar 9.1.1 is primarily a maintenance release with bugs fixed
and minor
features added. 9.1 also includes all of the features from 9.0
(Soar-RL).

Soar-EpMem is a task-independent, architectural integration of an
artificial
episodic memory (EpMem) with Soar.  The EpMem mechanism will
automatically
record episodes as a Soar agent executes.  These episodes can later be
queried
and retrieved in order to improve performance on future tasks. See the
EpMem
manual for details.

Soar 9.2.0 (Semantic Memory)
============================

Soar 9.2 includes a Semantic Memory module, and this release of Soar
9.2.0 is
the first official release of Soar with semantic memory capabilities.
9.2 also
includes all features from 9.1 (EpMem) and 9.0 (Soar-RL).

Soar-SMem is a task-independent, architectural integration of an
artificial
semantic memory (SMem) with Soar.  The SMem mechanism facilitates
deliberate
recording and querying of semantic chunks as a Soar agent executes.

Installation Requirements
=========================

These releases are generated for Windows, Linux, and OSX systems. 
Windows XP
and Vista are supported, as well as 32- and 64-bit architectures.

* IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT 64-BIT BINARIES: To use the 64-bit Soar tools
with Java
  (such as the Java debugger) you must be using the 64-bit JVM.
Attempting to
  start 64-bit Soar programs with the 32-bit JVM on Windows will cause a
  javaw.exe process to hang open (terminate it using task manager). Also
note:
  attempting to start 32-bit Java tools, such as those included in
previous
  distributions of Soar, with a 64-bit JVM will also result in the
hanging
  javaw.exe process.

* Sun Java 1.5 or newer is required to use the Java applications,
including the
  debugger (Java must be available in the path). Get it at
  http://java.sun.com/. Most operating systems probably already have
Java
  installed. NOTE: Java 1.4.2 is no longer supported.

* The Soar Suite needs under 100 MB for regular use, but closer to 1 GB
of disk
  space for object and debugging files if rebuilding all projects.

* Due to path length limits on some versions of Windows, it is
recommended
  to extract Soar to the C:\ root or similar. Some parts of the Soar
Suite
  directory structure are deep, so users wishing to put Soar in a deep
location
  on their machines (such as 
  C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\Visual Studio
Projects) may 
  run into issues.

* Tcl version 8.4 is required for the Tcl SML interface. Threaded Tcl
builds
  are not supported. Windows 64-bit does not include the Tcl SML
interface.
  Your installed Tcl architecture must be the same (32 or 64 bit) as the
Soar
  binaries for the Tcl SML interface to load correctly.

* The included Python libraries support Python 2.5.  Python 2.6 and 3
support
  requires a rebuild of the ClientSMLPython project. Your installed
Python
  architecture must be the same (32 or 64 bit) as the Soar binaries for
the 
  Python SML interface to load correctly.

Build Requirements
==================

Binaries are released for Windows/Linux/OS X, so building is not
required.  For
those on other platforms or developers:

* Compilers: Windows: Visual Studio 2005 SP1 or 2008, Linux/OS X: GCC
3.3 
  or later

* SWIG 1.3.31 or later is required to build with cross-language support
(e.g.
  to use the Java debugger).

* Apache ant is required to build Java projects.

* Only the Sun JDK will work, 1.5 or newer.

* On Linux/OS X: Scons, Python 2.5 or newer, Tcl 8.4

* Please see detailed build instructions available on http://msoar.org

New in 9.0.1, 9.1.1, 9.2.0
==========================

* Native 64-bit platform support for Windows, Linux, OSX (bugs 1139, 
  1064, 1036, 531) resulting in different, usually better performance
  on these platforms, and definite ease of compilation and integration
  with tools such as Java and Python.

* Visual Studio 2008 is now supported and its use is recommended. 
  Visual Studio 2005 support will likely be dropped with the next
  release.

* Soar 7 mode has been completely removed.

* Preference semantics regarding the generation of operator conflict
  impasses have changed, see appendix D in the Soar Manual for details.

* Test and Demo programs
* Documentation

New in 9.0.0
============

* Components and Capabilities added
  -- RL commands and documentation added (see RL manual and tutorial
     in Documentation directory).
  -- indifferent-selection command updated to support options primarily
     intended for (but not limited to) RL.
  -- select and predict commands added to control operator selection
     (essentially replaces defunct indifferent-selection --ask
functionality).
  -- New "gp" command added. Generates rules based on simple patterns
     (intended for use with RL).
  -- Added iterative deepening support to selection space. To see this
     in action, load the Water Jug Look-Ahead demo, then source
     selection-iterative-deepening.soar (in SoarLibrary/Demos/default)
     and run. Init-soar and run again. Iterative deepening is guaranteed
     to find the path with the fewest steps.
  -- Added options to learn command to turn chunking through local
negations
     on or off (on by default for backwards compatibility). If off, a
message
     will be generated if "watch --learning print" is enabled that says
a chunk
     was not created because of local negations, and what those
negations were.
  -- Updated selection space to remove local negations (for
compatibility with 
     new --disable-through-local-negations chunking mode). 
  -- In a tie impasse, an item-count WME containing the number of tied
operators 
     is now architecturally generated.
  -- Depth at which productions are firing is reported at watch 5.
  -- Multiple rules can be loaded via the Java debugger's Edit
Production
     widget, scratch pad, and by pasting into the trace window. This is
the
     result of an underlying change to SML in which arguments to
     ExecuteCommandLine are passed through logic associated with the
source
     command, and thus multiple commands can be given at once.
  -- Command boxes in the Java debugger have been enhanced so that
history
     browsing with the up/down arrows works on all platforms.
  -- New "single compilation unit" build configurations (greatly speeds
build time).
  -- Unit test suite added.
  -- Other minor enhancements.

* Bug fixes
  -- Output link supports circular structures.
  -- Duplicate productions no longer cause sourcing to stop.
  -- Various memory leaks fixed.
  -- Several other minor fixes.

* Other updates
  -- Removed gSKI (10-30% speed increase in simple benchmarking).
  -- The Soar Java Debugger now uses its default layout the first time
     it is run with a new version of Soar. Old layouts are preserved
     and can be loaded if desired (which makes them the default).


Known issues:
=============

* ^status complete appears on the ^output-link immediately instead 
  of during the next input phase.
* The Soar 7 mode implementation currently relies on an ugly hack. If
  you experience problems in this mode, please let us know.
* Many other minor issues (see bugzilla for details).

<pre>Soar 8.6.4 Release Notes
========================

This release of Soar includes reinforcement learning code (Soar-RL).

Soar-RL is the architectural integration of reinforcement learning
(RL) with Soar.  The RL mechanism will automatically learn value
functions as a Soar agent executes.  These value functions represent,
for a given working memory state and proposed operator, the expected
sum of future rewards the agent will receive if it selects that
operator.

Note: in the final version of Soar-RL, all Soar impasses will be
treated identically.  In the case of an impasse other than
operator no-change, the time period at the superstate during
which no operator is selected will be treated as a gap in rule
coverage, and perceived reward will be discounted with respect to
decision cycles passed.

This release also includes an important bug fix regarding shared ids,
see bugzilla bug number 1027 for details.

The 8.6.4 release notes follow.

New in 8.6.2
============

* Components and Capabilities added:
  -- C# added to list of supported languages (now C++, Java, Tcl, C#).
  -- Java versions of Eaters and TankSoar  
  -- Support for arbitrary communication from one client to 
     another (not just to/from the kernel)
  -- Tcl commands can now be used from the SoarJavaDebugger by running 
     a separate Tcl filter alongside the debugger 
     (this is a preliminary version in this release).
  -- Support for filtering of command line input in any supported
language 
     Filtering can be chained.  
  -- Support for logging output in SoarJavaDebugger on a
window-by-window basis
  -- Support for arbitrary logging of Soar execution through custom
logging 
     applications.  Sample programs included in Tools directory.
  -- Added new SML tutorial for developers (in Environments/JavaTOH)
  -- Ability to unregister an event during its callback execution
  -- Support for setting a "stop-point" before any phase in Soar's 
     execution cycle. Upon interrupt, or when stepping, agents will 
     stop at this location.  By default Soar will stop after the 
     decision phase so users can examine the match set.
  -- "run 0" (zero) will move agents to the stop-point location, 
     unless already there.  (mechanism for synching agents easily)
  -- Applications can interleave the execution of multiple agents by 
     any increment supported in SoarKernel: elaboration, phase, decision
     or output-generation.  
  -- Phase-specific event generation  (e.g. BEFORE_PROPOSE_PHAE & 
     AFTER_PROPOSE_PHASE etc)
  -- Input wmes are now automatically committed by default removing the
need
     to manually call commit().
 
* Performance improvements:
  -- Windows performance improved (> 30% faster in Towers of Hanoi SML).
  -- Vastly improved Linux performance (~20x in some cases).
  -- Java versions of Eaters and TankSoar are many times faster than
     their Tcl equivalents.

* Updates and code fixes
  -- New algorithm in SoarKernel supports more efficient garbage 
     collection, won't blow callstack when lots of work done in subgoal,

     and  supports undefining DO_TOP_LEVEL_REF_CTS which inherently 
     leaks memory at the top state
  -- Fixed logic for checking quiescence in Propose phase.  For some
     applications using I/O, could result in fewer SNCs in substates  
  -- Reorganized directory structure to be more intuitive.
  -- Static libraries required for building SML applications are now
     distributed in SoarLibrary/lib.
  -- Many memory leaks fixed in SoarKernel, gSKI and SML.
  -- RunEvents generated directly in SoarKernel rather than by gSKI.
  -- SML RunScheduler rewritten.  Order of RunEvents guaranteed for all
agents.
  -- init-soar support works much better for all clients.
  -- Updated Java apps to SWT 3.1.2.
  -- Java 5.0 supported.
  -- Visual Studio 2005 supported.
  -- Java Debugger now uses GTK interface by default in Linux (fixes
     many motif-specific bugs).
  -- Lots of SML changes to improve correctness and functionality.
  -- Registering for callbacks in Java now uses interfaces.
  -- Several Soar7-mode commands added back in.
  -- Soar kernel now uses a new random number generator.
  -- Improved portability and removed legacy files from SoarKernel.
  -- Lots of documentation updates.
  -- Many, many other changes (see bugzilla for details).
  -- more details posted at

<pre>Announcing Soar 8.6.1!
======================

This announcement describes the primary changes in this latest release.
It also 
includes the 8.6.0 announcement for reference (read that first if you
didn't
download 8.6.0).

Soar 8.6.1 can be downloaded from the Soar homepage at:

http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

Requirements
============

* Java 1.4.2 or later required to use the Java debugger (java should be 
  available in the path). Get it at http://java.sun.com/. Most machines 
  probably already have this installed.

* Tcl 8.4.x or later required to run Eaters on linux and OS X 10.3 (wish
  should be available in the path). Get it at http://www.tcl.tk/. OS X
10.4
  comes with this pre-installed, and the Windows installer includes it.

New in this release
===================

* Capabilities added:
  -- Linux and Mac support
  -- Soar 7 mode now works.  Some Soar7 demos are included as well.
  -- Tcl Eaters is included.  Tcl Eaters uses the familiar Eaters
Control Panel, 
     but the default Agent window is the new SoarJavaDebugger.  The TSI
is only
     partially converted to the new SML interface to Soar, and the
SoarJavaDebugger
     is more capable and better integrated.
  -- Java Missionaries and Cannibals is included.
  -- Added ability to filter trace output in debugger after a trace has
been created
  -- Added ability to stop scrolling trace window in debugger
  -- Added partial command matching for command line.
  -- Introduced new event-driven simulation support, removing the need
for
     "start-system" command (see "SML Quick Start Guide" for details).
  -- Clients can now determine when other clients are connected and
ready
  -- sml.jar now included in soar-library for Java developers.
  -- TestSMLEvents application added: provides a rudimentary command
line interface 
     so the users can test the events and view examples of each.

* Performance further improved:
  -- Improved and extended kernel XML generation resulting in
performance boost
     for those applications which use it (i.e. the Java debugger)
  -- Better use of threads in Java debugger resulting in massive
performance boost
  -- Replaced tree trace window in debugger with faster version
  -- New threading model in SML for better performace with multiple
applications

* Updates and fixes
  -- Running by phases and elaborations now works properly: Propose and
Apply run 
     to full quiescence when running by Phase; when running by
Elaboration, Soar
     will always run one round of production firings, which might
require that
     Input, Decide or Output phases be executed as well.
  -- Manual updated
  -- Tutorials for new debugger updated
  -- Added lots of aliases that existed in older versions of Soar
  -- Rewrote command line parsing code to avoid potential licensing
issues
  -- Numerous other smaller bug fixes.

Clarification regarding the "tcl" RHS function:
===============================================

While we are no longer providing a built-in "tcl" RHS function, there is nothing
to prevent someone from registering the old "tcl" RHS function which does the
same thing. Those needing to support legacy code should do this.  Those 
applications will then require that Tcl is always part of the build.
For new applications,  "exec" provides the same functionality in a 
language-independent way.

Known issues:
=============

* VisualSoar seems to have intermittent issues on some OS X machines.
This appears to be a bug in Java on that platform.
* Log command only works properly from Java debugger if in text mode (as
opposed to tree mode).
* Tanksoar is not yet available.
* Soar seems to "stutter" under Mac OS 10.4 (but it does work properly).
* Sometimes the trace output can fall behind actual execution, making
  the debugger appear unresponsive (it's really just trying to catch up).
* Some rare warning messages may not appear fully in the Java debugger's
tree view (but they appear fine in the text view). If you find specific
cases of this, please let us know.
* Pausing trace window in debugger causes the text to flicker on Windows
and Linux and doesn't work well on OS X (these are os and SWT issues; we can't
fix them).
* VisualSoar can only connect to kernel using default values for
port/ip.
* When running Eaters on Linux with a debugger connected, the debugger
seems to "steal" the focus while Soar is running.
* For Soar7 mode, the commands attribute-preferences-mode and
input-period  are not yet implemented.  
* Also in Soar 7 mode, a potential crash from tentative-retractions of
  justifications, that has existed since 8.5.2 and possibly earlier, 
  is avoided with an ugly hack;  please contact us if you suspect you are
  running into problems related to this issue.

= 8.6.0 =
<pre>Announcing Soar 8.6.0!
======================

This announcement describes the primary changes in this latest release.
Among
them are:

* Limitations in this release
* SML: A new XML-based API for interfacing with Soar
* A new Soar debugger written in Java
* Command line changes

Soar 8.6.0 can be downloaded from the Soar homepage at:

http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

Limitations in this release
===========================

* 8.6.0 is a Windows-only release.
* The manual needs more work (but it is included).
* Soar7 mode (i.e. soar8 --off) does not work yet.
* The tutorial needs to be updated so it is not included.
* Eaters and TankSoar are not included.
* The Java components have only been tested on Java 1.4.2. There may be
problems
  if used with Java 1.5.
* The "Soar Runtime" menu in VisualSoar is not functional.

We anticipate an 8.6.1 release before the Soar workshop which should
include
Linux and Mac releases, support for Soar7 mode, and will possibly
address some
of these other issues as well.

If any other issues or bugs are found, please send mail to:

soar-sml-list@lists.sourceforge.net

SML: A new XML-based API for interfacing with Soar
==================================================

Interfacing to Soar has always been something of a challenge.  Initially
we were
limited to building interfaces in the Soar implementation language (LISP
then
C/C++).  We extended this to allow the use of Tcl but the extension
ended up
requiring Tcl for all Soar systems.  SGIO opened up support for having a
simulation running either with Soar embedded or as a separate process
but it was
limited to sending just I/O information which prevented debugging of
embedded
processes.  gSKI provided a clean interface into the kernel but support
for
other languages, debugging or remote I/O has yet to be implemented.

With this 8.6 release we are providing an alternative approach for
interfacing
into Soar called SML (Soar Markup Language). This interface:

* supports multiple languages (Java, C++ and Tcl currently) while
removing any
requirement on Tcl

* supports a uniform method for building I/O interfaces (for
simulations) as
well as command interfaces (for debugging)

* supports embedding Soar kernels within a simulation or debugger and
communicating remotely between the two

* supports multiple clients (debuggers, simulations, other tools)
connecting
to a single kernel instance

* supports dynamic connection and disconnection of tools (esp debuggers)
from a running kernel

* provides a uniform, high level and data-driven model for the interface
while
retaining high performance

* moves command line support out of the kernel, while providing
universal
access to it from any client

* includes a new, cleaned up command line syntax

* in many cases the interface is faster (sometimes an order of magnitude
faster) than our 8.5.2 interfaces

* includes gSKI in the main Soar Consortium kernel for the first time

* follows the SGIO interface model in many ways, making converting
existing
simulations easier

Through these changes, the kernel itself has been largely unchanged so
sets of
productions from 8.5.2 should run identically in 8.6 although some
command line
arguments (e.g. "learning -off") have changed slightly so they will
require
updating.  Details on that below.

The Soar Java debugger
======================
A preliminary new debugger in Java is provided which interfaces with
Soar via SML.
This new debugger:

* has much higher performance than the TSI for detailed traces
* already offers a structured view of high watch traces
* can be dynamically attached to and detached from remote Soar instances
* is designed to be highly customizable by each user
* employs a plug-in architecture to allow for modular extensions in the
future

At this point the debugger should be considered a beta version.

Command Line Changes
====================
One of the major changes in Soar 8.6 is syntax changes for the commands.
 The
syntax was changed to increase consistency across commands and greatly
increase ease of parsing of commands (making adding new commands much
easier).
Unfortunately, this means that some common commands used in Soar source
files need
to be changed before those files will load in Soar 8.6.

Options now require two dashes before the unabbreviated name (e.g. run
--decision 3)
and a single dash before the abbreviated name (e.g. run -d 3).

For complete documentation on the current syntax of the commands, use
the "help"
command, read the manual, or read the documentation online at:
http://winter.eecs.umich.edu/soarwiki/Soar_Command_Line_Interface.

For your convenience, here are some of the most common changes that are
required
to allow existing source files to load:

* learn -on => learn --on
* set warnings off => warnings --off

RHS function changes:

* "tcl" is no longer supported.  It has been replaced by "exec" (for
user-provided
functions) and "cmd" to execute standard command-line commands. 
User-provided
functions must be registered with the Soar kernel via a call to
Kernel::AddRhsFunction.

* Built-in RHS functions like "write" and the math functionality are
unchanged.

* See sections 3.3.6.6 to 3.3.6.12 (especially 3.3.6.11) for more
information on RHS
functions.

These common commands have NOT changed:

* multi-attributes
* pushd
* popd
* sp

To learn more about SML, the debugger or how to build a simulation using
the new
interface please see the documentation included with the release.

         Summary of changes between SoarSuite 8.5.1 and SoarSuite 8.5.2
                            July, 2004


A summary of changes in SoarSuite 8.5.2 is listed immediately below. For
more
details, including changes not mentioned in the summary and a list of
known
issues see the Details section after the summary.

======================
New Windows Installer:
======================

	The Windows installer is now built with a different technology which
is much easier for us and results in a much smaller package.

=========================
Several kernel bug fixes:
=========================

	Almost all known bugs fixed, including all known crash bugs. See the
details section below for more information.

==================
New TankSoar Bots:
==================

	TankSoar now comes with two new bots.  Mapping-bot demonstrates how a
tank might build up an internal map of the level.  Obscure-bot is a
challenge bot
for people to test their own bots against.  The code is provided in an
obfuscated
binary.  See obscure-bot.txt in the TankSoar agents directory for
details.

==========================
SoarDoc and DMGen updated:
==========================

	These changes were actually in the the 8.5.1 release, but we failed
to note them.
SoarDoc:
 - Fixed special character handling when UseExistingComments is used.
 - Added ShowProdSourceInline which shows production source code
   inline in the production documentation
 - Ability disable datamap node coloring
 - Fixed case-sensitivity issues for production names and list sorting.
DMGen:
 - Fixed handling of mixed-case production names.

======================
Documentation Updated:
======================

	The tutorials have had some typo fixes and screenshot updates, and
also
explain substates better.

==================
Tcl Soar Debugger:
==================

	The TSDebugger has several bug fixes which may have affected some
users.

===================
VisualSoar Updated:
===================

	VisualSoar has several small bug fixes.

======================
Critical SGIO bug fix:
======================

	Our fix for bug 254 in the last release actually caused serious
problems. This has been fixed for real now.

====================================================================

<pre>Summary of changes between SoarSuite 8.5.0 and SoarSuite 8.5.1
                            June, 2004


A summary of changes in SoarSuite 8.5.1 is listed immediately below. For
more
details, including changes not mentioned in the summary and a list of
known
issues see the Details section after the summary.

==================
Several bug fixes:
==================

Almost all known bugs fixed, including all known crash bugs. See the
details
section below for more information.

======================
Documentation Updated:
======================

	The manual has been updated to include appendices on the BNF grammar
for Soar's syntax, the calculation of O Support, the resolution of
preferences
and the Goal Dependency Set, as well as many other small changes. The
manual
is also now searchable, and the table of contents has links to the
associated
sections. Finally, the tutorial has been reorganized.

==================================
New Tcl Soar Debugger (TSI 4.0.0):
==================================

	The Tcl debugger, TSI, has undergone a major revision, improving its
intuitiveness and presentation of information dramatically. For more
details,
see the TSI 4 Tour documentation.

=======================
Updated Version of Tcl:
=======================

	The system has been tested with the latest version of Tcl, 8.4.6, and
the Windows distribution ships with this version included.

========================
Learning Off by Default:
========================

	In previous versions of Soar, learning was turned on by default. This
could be a source of confusion and frustration since most users do not
intend to
have learning on. Thus, starting with Soar 8.5.1, learning is turned
off.

====================================
O Support Mode 4 is now the Default:
====================================

	O Support Mode 4 was introduced in Soar 8.5.0, and starting with Soar
8.5.1 it is now the default mode. Those requiring other modes (i.e. for
compatibility) can switch to them using the o-support-mode command.
	O Support Mode 3 (the default mode in Soar 8.3 - 8.5.0) is meant to
give I-Support to elaborations of the operator.  At certain times,
these elaborations were not detected as such, and received O-Support.
Soar 8.5's O Support Mode 4 can overcome these problems by detecting
more operator elaborations.  However, it also makes the following change
from O-Support Mode 3:
	mixed productions (i.e. operator applications + operator elaborations)
now receive i-support instead of o-support.  Running with 'warnings -on'
will print messages when any such productions fire.  You should try
to be careful not to build any such mixed productions when using
o-support mode 4
	While O Support Mode 3 remains the default for this release, this is
for backwards compatibility only.  It is recommended that O Support Mode
4 is
used from now on; in a future release, O Support Mode 4 will be the
default.

======================
New Interrupt Command:
======================

	Soar 8.5.1 now allows matchtime interrupts to be turned on and off at
runtime. Matchtime interrupts were introduced in Soar 8.5.0 (see
immediately
below for details). The syntax for the interrupt command is:
	
	interrupt [-on|-off] [production name]

	If the -on or -off switch is used without a production name, then the
list of all productions with interrupts turned on or off is given. If
the
production name is used without the -on or -off switch, then the
interrupt
status of the production is given.

	Soar 8.5.0 introducted support for interrupting execution at
production
match-time in addition to interrupts when a production matches.  This
new
capability makes it possible to examine Soar's state before the
production
fires, and even makes it possible to excise the production that matches
before
its effects are realized.  To use the matchtime interrupt feature,
productions
must add the ':interrupt' directive as in the following example
production:

	sp { interrupt*on*application
			 :interrupt
	   (state <s> ^operator.name stop)
	-->
           (write (crlf) |I've already Halted|)}

Note that supporting this feature adds a small amount of computational
overhead
to the match phase.  If you desire a maximally streamlined version of
Soar,
recompile /without/ the MATCHTIME_INTERRUPT flag in soarBuildOptions.h 

===================
VisualSoar Updated:
===================

VisualSoar has undergone several usability improvements for this
development
iteration.  Key among these are:
 - highlighting code for the user that has been identified
   as the cause of a syntax error, datamap error or text search.
 - improvements to window focus, size and positioning.  In the past,
   VisualSoar has been a little too "bullheaded" about enforcing the
   default display type of tile mode.  Users who maximize windows or
   cascade them will find VS easier to manage.
 - some additional search capabilities.  In particular, it's easy to
   find code corresponding to entries in the datamap and also easy to
   find the datamap that goes with particular code.  You can also
   limit your text searches to specific operator subtrees.
 - Finally, VisualSoar has been made compatible with MacOS.

Summary of changes between Soar 8.4.5 and Soar 8.5. Scott Wallace
August, 2003

The change from Soar8.4.5 to Soar8.5 introduces some new features, and
bug fixes. Below is a brief summary of the salient changes (all
modifications have been verified with the soar-8.5-test-suite which is
released independently from this source code).

== Operator No Changes ==

In Soar 8.4.5, Operator No Changes were identified agressively by the
architecture. This meant that they could be created before the end of
the decision cycle. In some situations, this led to odd behavior,
notably within some of the tutorial lessions. As a result, this behavior
has now become a compile-time option and is no longer included in the
deafult-builds. If you desire Soar with aggressive no changes, simply
add the AGRESSIVE_ONC flag to soarBuildOptions.h and recompile.

== MatchTime Interrupt ==

Soar 8.5 now supports interrupting execution at production match-time in
addition to interrupts when a production matches. This new capability
makes it possible to examine Soar's state before the production fires,
and even makes it possible to excise the production that matches before
its effects are realized. To use the matchtime interrupt feature,
productions must add the `:interrupt` directive as in the following
example production: 
<pre>sp { interrupt*on*application 
:interrupt 
    (state <s> ^operator.name stop) 
-->
    (write (crlf) |I've already Halted|)
}
</pre>

Note that supporting this feature adds a small amount of computational
overhead to the match phase. If you desire a maximally streamlined
version of Soar, recompile /without/ the MATCHTIME_INTERRUPT flag in
soarBuildOptions.h

== Reject Preferences ==

Earlier versions of Soar processed all reject preferences after
acceptable preferences. One of the unintuitive side effects of this is
that when a user wants to change the value of a wme, they typically need
to test that its current value is not equal to the new value. As a first
attempt to alleviate this artifact, by default Soar 8.5 changes the
order in which preferences are evaluated by examining O-Supported Reject
preferences first thus (^cheese-type cheddar - chedder +) will result in
the wme (... ^cheese-type cheddar) remaining in working-memory. Note
that this may have some unanticipated consequences, and can be turned
off be undefining the O_REJECTS_FIRST flag in soarBuildOptions.h and
recompiling.

== Cmdline Interface Parser ==

Now appropriately parses strings containing the '#' character.

== Run Till Output ==

In Soar 8.3 - 8.4.5, if an output command was issued in the first
decision-cycle, it would not be appropriately detected. As a result, if
Soar was instructed to run until output, and output occured on the 1st
decision cycle, Soar would continue running for 15 decision cycles
before returning control to the user. This bug was most often noticed
using simple agents in TankSoar, and is now fixed in Soar 8.5.

== O Support Mode 4 == 
O Support Mode 3 (the default mode in Soar 8.3 - 8.5.0) is meant to give
I-Support to elaborations of the operator. At certain times, these
elaborations were not detected as such, and received O-Support. Soar
8.5's O Support Mode 4 can overcome these problems by detecting more
operator elaborations. However, it also makes the following change from
O-Support Mode 3: 

mixed productions (i.e. operator applications + operator elaborations)
now receive i-support instead of o-support. Running with 'warnings -on'
will print messages when any such productions fire. You should try to be
careful not to build any such mixed productions when using o-support
mode 4

While O Support Mode 3 remains the default for this release, this is for
backwards compatibility only. It is recommended that O Support Mode 4 is
used from now on; in a future release, O Support Mode 4 will be the
default.

== Numeric Indifference Preferences== 

Soar 8.5 has better capabilities to support behavioral diversity than
previous versions of Soar. The difference stems from Soar 8.5 numeric
indifferent preferences that allow operators to be assigned weights
along with the '=' preference. In the event of a tie, the indifference
selection mechanism is invoked. In previous versions of Soar, the
probability of selecting any of the tied operators was distributed
evenly among the candidates (assuming the indifferent-selection mode was
'random'). Soar 8.5's numeric indifferent preferences allow the
programmer to skew this distribution such that certain operators are
chosen more or less frequently. Preferences are specified simply by
adding an integer or float value following an operator's '=' preference.
As in the example below: 

<pre>sp { example 
    (state <s> ^superstate nil -^initialized true) 
--> 
    (<s> ^operator <o> + = 30) 
    (&lt;o&gt; ^name initialize-a)
}
</pre>

Two algorithms are available via a run-time switch: 
<pre>numeric-indifferent-mode -avg
</pre>

Here, we calculate the 'average' preference value associated with a
particular operator. Thus, if preference A for operator X has value 30
while preference B for operator X has value 60, the average will be 45.
Once this value has been calculated for all competeing operators, we sum
their average preferences and select a random number between 0 and this
sum. Each operator is associated with a range on this scal equal to its
average numeric preference. Thus, the randomly selected number can
simply be mapped back to an operator that then becomes for 'selected'
operator for the current decison. In average mode, indifferent
preferences without a numeric value are given the default value of 50
for selection purposes. For programmers, we expect that this mode of
numeric-indifferent selection will be most intuitive. Note however, that
this scheme doesn't make a lot of sense for preferences are less than
zero. If an operator's average value is ever below zero, Soar will print
a warning indicating this situation. As an initial recommendation, we
suggest using values between 0.0 and 100.0 for your operators. 

<pre>numeric-indifferent-mode -sum
</pre>

Here, the preferences for each operator are first summed. Thus, if
preference A for operator X has value 30 while preference B for operator
X has value 70.5 the sum will be 100.5. This sum is calculated for all
competing operators. Next, we calculate: e ^ (preference_sum /
agent_temperature) where agent_temperature is a compile time constant
currently set at 25.0 We'll call this value the operator's final numeric
preference. Finally, we sum all the competing operator's final numeric
preferences and select a random number between 0 and this sum. Each
operator is associated with a range on this scale equal to the size of
its final numeric preference. Thus, the randomly selected number can
simply be mapped back to an operator that then becomes the 'selected'
operator for the current decision. In the sum mode, indifferent
preferences without a numeric value are given the default value 0.0 for
the selection purposes. Note it does make sense to use this methodology
even if the numeric preferences are negative, however, because the
numeric preference are used in exponientation, their values should be
somewhat limited so floating-point overflow does not become a problem.
We expect this sum mode to be more useful for future
reinforcement-learning methods, and have included it here mainly for
experimental purposes.

== Timer Warnings ==

Timer warnings are not displayed unless the following are true: 

  * Soar was compiled with the WARN_IF_TIMERS_REPORT_ZERO flag 
  * at runtime, the 'warnings' sysparam is set to TRUE (as with the
'warnings -on' command

Other changes for Soar 8.5 made after the above document was written:
  * Removal of many depricated Tcl/Tk functions, upgrading them to
Tcl/Tk 8.4.4.
  * Various stability enhancements, including:
    * Kernel now uses snprintf() instead of sprintf() whenever possible.
    * Kernel now uses strncpy() instead of strcpy() whenever possible.
    * Kernel now uses strncat() instead of strcat() whenever possible.
  * 'verbose' command bug fix, it was not working as documented when
multiple agents were active.
  * 'init-soar' kernel crash fixed in both Eaters and TankSoar.
  * MSVC and GCC warning levels moved to maximum, all warnings silenced.
  * Logging bug fixed, did not work properly with multiple active
agents.
  * 'indifferent-selection -ask' command fixed.
  * Decision cycle bug fix.
  * All demos are in VisualSoar format now.
  * Fixed a kernel crash related to justifications.
