= Blocks-World Hierarchical Look-Ahead Agent =
This project contains a version of blocks world that is formulated for hierarchical task decomposition.  It uses three levels of problem spaces with look-ahead in the middle problem space. For the top and bottom problem spaces, there is pre-existing selection knowledge that is sufficient to eliminate search.

The middle problem space consists of the pick-up and put-down operators. For that problem space there are rules that create the internal copy of the state and rules that simulate the actions on that internal copy. Finally, there are rules that provide some evaluations for the lookahead.

The top level has a single operator: move-block, which moves a block (moving-block) to a destination. The destination can be the top of another block or the table.

The next level consists of two operators: pick-up and put-down and they arise in an operator no-change for move-block. The rules for these are found under move-block. This level introduces the gripper, which can be holding a block or empty and is a structure on the top state.

The bottom level has a variety of operators: open-gripper, close-gripper, move-gripper-above, move-gripper-down, and move-gripper-up. The structures manipulated by these operators are part of the gripper structure on the top state. These operators arise in an operator no-change for both pick-up and put-down and the rules for them are under pick-up.
