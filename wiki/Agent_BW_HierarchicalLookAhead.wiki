= Blocks-World Hierarchical Look-Ahead Agent =
This project augments the [Agent_BW_Hierarchical Blocks-World Hierarchical Agent] with look-ahead state evaluation.  The description of the original agent applies to this one.  The main difference is that look-ahead is performed in the middle of the three problem spaces that it uses.
