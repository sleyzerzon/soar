= Water Jug Look-Ahead Agent =

This agent is a modification of the [Agent_WJ_Simple Water Jug Simple Agent] that demonstrates using a tie impasse to subgoal and evaluate operators.  This is an excellent demonstration of look-ahead search and how the selection default rules work.

Unlike the [Agent_WJ_Tie Water Jug Tie Agent], the look-ahead agent has no knowledge that prefers certain moves over others, so it does exhaustive search which takes far more decision cycles.
