= Getting the Source =

There are two ways to get the source code:
  # Download the the [http://soar.googlecode.com/files/SoarSuite-9.3.1-source.tar.gz 9.3.1 platform-independent source].  This will contain the last major release of the entire SoarSuite.  It will probably contain many modules that you don't need.
  # Checkout the latest code directly from the Soar SVN repository.

If you chose the first option and manually downloaded the full SoarSuite, skip down to your operating system notes below:

  * [http://code.google.com/p/soar/wiki/Build#Windows Windows Build Notes]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/soar/wiki/Build#Linux Linux Build Notes]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/soar/wiki/Build#Mac_OS_X Mac OS X Build Notes]

Otherwise, follow the instructions in the next section to download Soar from the SVN repository.

== How to Check Out Soar from SVN ==

  # Install a subversion client (a revision control program that allows you to download the Soar source code from the SVN repository)
    ** *Windows*: get [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads TortoiseSVN] (GUI) and/or [http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download SlikSVN] (command line).
    ** *Ubuntu Linux*: Install package `subversion`.
    ** *Mac*: Do nothing! Subversion ships with Leopard and newer.
  # Check out `SoarSuite` *non-recursively*
    ** *Do not check out the entire trunk.* The SoarSuite contains many projects that you probably will not need. For now, you just want to check out the top level folder and the immediate files within it. In the next step, you will add the individual components that you need for your project. 
    ** The URL for the repository is *http://soar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SoarSuite/ * (if you are a Soar developer affiliated with the U of M and plan to check in changes, use *https:// *)
    ** To check out the top-level folder, do the following: 
      ** *Command-line SVN program*: Use the command `svn checkout http://soar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SoarSuite --depth files`
      ** *TortoiseSVN (Windows)*: Right click in the folder that you want to install the SoarSuite in and select "Checkout". A [http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-checkout.html checkout dialog box] will appear.  Change the _Checkout Depth_ option to _Only file children_.  Click OK.
    ** *Note*:  Your username is your Google account name without the `@` or domain. [http://code.google.com/hosting/settings Your password is your googlecode.com password].
  # Check out the component that you will need for what you're trying to do.
    ** Here is a partial list of components you can check out.
      ** *Core*: *Required* module.  Contains the Soar kernel.
      ** *Java*: *Required* module, used to interface with Java, which almost everyone will need since the Soar debugger is written in Jave.
      ** *Python*: Used to interface with Python code.
      ** *CSharp*: Used to interface with CSharp code.
      ** *Tcl*: Used to interface with Tcl code.
      ** *Soar2d*: Contains the TankSoar and Eaters test environments used in the Soar tutorial
      ** A full list of components is available [ProjectLayout#Components here].
    ** *Command-line SVN program*: There are command-line shortcuts in the [http://code.google.com/p/soar/source/browse/trunk/SoarSuite/Makefile Makefile] at the top level.  Simply type the shortcut in, and it will retrieve the files.  For example, `make checkout` will checkout the core and java files.
    ** *TortoiseSVN (Windows)*:
      # Open up your SoarSuite folder and right-click within in and choose TortoiseSVN->Repo Browser
      # Choose the packages that you want (ctrl-click to select multiple packages)
      # Right-click on the selected packages and choose 'Checkout' (fully recursive setting is ok here)

You can now skip to your operating system build notes:
