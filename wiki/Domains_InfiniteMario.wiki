= Infinite Mario =

This environment is derived from the Infinite Mario domain from RLCompetition2009 (based on RL-Glue) and uses SML to connect to Soar.

Agents play a variant of Super Mario, a complete side-scrolling video game with destructible blocks, enemies, fireballs, coins, chasms, platforms, etc. The state space is complicated, but factored in an object-oriented way, which captures many aspects of the real world. Challenges include:

  * Path planning: How can Mario navigate around simple obstacles, or through complicated sets of blocks?
  * Option learning and execution: Are there reusable sensory-motor primitives which simplify planning? Can these be learned?
  * Explore / exploit: Do enemies always behave the same way? Are there stochastic effects of blocks that can be learned?
