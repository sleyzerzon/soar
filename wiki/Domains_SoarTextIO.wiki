= SoarText/IO =

The purpose of this tool is to allow the Soar programmer to interact with a Soar agent while it is running. SoarTextIO allows you to communicates with an agent via plain sentences that it translates into a linked list of words.

Why is this useful? Imagine you have written a Soar agent that solves algebra problems. SoarTextIO provides a way for you to give the agent equations to solve on the fly. Or, say that you have written an exploration bot in a simulation whose goal is to find different locations on a map. SoarTextIO allows you to continually give the agent different locations to find.
