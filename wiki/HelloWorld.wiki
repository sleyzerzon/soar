#summary How to program a simple, external environment for Soar in Java.

This document is not an introduction to Soar programming. Please refer to the Soar Tutorial documents included with the release if you are new to Soar.

This document does point to resources explaining how to create simple external environments with Soar using Java.

= Setup =

[Build Checkout and build] at least the Core and Java components. You will need `sml.jar` and `soar-smljava-(version).jar` in your classpath to run the examples. On unix systems, don't forget to update your environment for loading shared libraries.



= Hello World =

[http://soar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SoarSuite/Java/SMLJava/src/main/java/edu/umich/soar/examples/HelloWorld.java HelloWorld.java] is a very simple Soar environment intended to explain the basics of using SML with Java. The source file is verbosely commented with explanations.

[http://soar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SoarSuite/Java/SMLJava/src/main/resources/helloworld.soar helloworld.soar] is the source file for use with the environment and is also commented with explanation.

= Simple Asynchronous Interactive Environment =

[http://soar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SoarSuite/Java/SMLJava/src/main/java/edu/umich/soar/examples/SimpleAsyncEnv.java SimpleAsyncEnv.java] is a more complex interactive asynchronous environment. The source file is verbosely commented with explanations.

[http://soar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SoarSuite/Java/SMLJava/src/main/resources/simpleasyncenv.soar simpleasyncenv.soar] is the source file for use with the environment and is also commented with explanation.
