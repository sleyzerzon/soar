= Description =
This command removes productions from Soar's memory.  The command must be called with either a specific production name or with a flag that indicates a particular group of productions to be removed.  Using the flag '''-a''' or '''--all''' also causes an init-soar.

= Examples = 
This command removes  the  production  my*first*production  and  all chunks:
 excise my*first*production --chunks

This removes all productions and does an init-soar:
 excise --all
