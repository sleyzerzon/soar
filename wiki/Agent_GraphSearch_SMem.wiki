= Graph Search Agent with Semantic Memory =
This agent demonstrates the use of semantic memory by extending the capabilities of the [Agent_GraphSearch Graph Search Agent].  The description of that agent also applies here.

Has two different uses of semantic memory:
  * Can hold its mission in wm or smem, which is a list of waypoints to visit. This works fine.
{{{
^parameters.mission-storage [ wm smem ]
}}}
  * Can hold all of its waypoints in semantic memory or working memory. 
{{{
^waypoint-storage [ smem wm ]
}}}
