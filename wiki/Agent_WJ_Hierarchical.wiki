= Water Jug Hierarchical Task Decomposition Agent =
This project contains a version of the water jug problem that is formulated for hierarchical task decomposition.  It involves two levels of problem spaces. 
 
The top level has three operators: fill, empty or pour.  The next level consists of three operators: pick-up, fill-jug and put-down and they arise in an operator no-change for the super state.

*Note*:  This agent works with chunking, which compiles the actions in the substates into rules that apply at the top-state.  Use the command "learn -e" to turn on chunking, run the agent once, init-soar  then run the agent again to see how the learned productions eliminate the need to subgoal in the second run.
