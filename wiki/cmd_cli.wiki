#summary cli command documentation
= cli =

Manipulate external command line interface modules.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
cli <module-name> on|off
}}}

=== Default Aliases ===

None.

== Options ==

|| `on` || Turn a command-line module on. ||
|| `off` || Turn a command-line module on ||

== Description ==

The `cli` command is used to interface to special, external libraries that extend the functionality of the Soar command line interface.  For example, a module may provide the ability to run Tcl or Python code from any Soar command line.

The first time that you turn a module on, Soar will attempt to look for a dynamically-linked library based on the module-name passed to the cli command.  Specifically, it looks for a dll named `[dllprefix][language]SoarLib.[dllextension]`.  (The dll prefix and extension vary depending on the platform.)

When the `on` parameter is given, all future Soar commands will be passed to the module for processing.  This allows the module to provide additional functionality. Similarly, the off message will send the CLI library an `off` message that will cause it to unregister all relevant callback handlers and stop processing Soar commands.


== Examples ==

To turn on Tcl mode:

{{{
cli tcl on
}}}

To turn off Tcl mode:

{{{
cli tcl off
}}}
