  * (Tutorial 1) Note that when using a web browser to connect to services, it may ask for user/pass, it is expecting your Windows login.
  * (Tutorial 3) This does not appear to be true: ''The !ServiceUri parameter specifies a location for the initial state document. This is expressed as a URI relative to the store directory. So in this case, the initial state document should be store/!ServiceTutorial3.xml''
    * For me, it appeared in the base dir: '''C:\Microsoft Robotics Studio (1.5)\!ServiceTutorial3.xml'''
  * (Tutorial 6) This does not appear to be correct: ''The above code uses a concise syntax for sending...''

MS Robotics Studio simulation environment *DOES NOT WORK* on Windows XP 64

[http://www.soft-tech.com.au/MSRS/ Trevor Taylor MSRS Code Page]

= Soar MSRS Service =

== Maze Simulation Dependency ==

First, install Trevor Taylor's code:
  * http://www.soft-tech.com.au/MSRS/Downloads/QUTJul2007.zip
  * Unzip to C:\Microsoft Robotics Studio (1.5) so that it adds an Apps folder tree (and some other files in the MSRS root).

Run RebuildQUTApps.cmd to build Maze Simulation
  * Test simulation by running `RunIntro.bat` from within a robotics command prompt (so the environment is set-up)
  * Make sure this is running before proceeding.

== Soar service ==

Next, check out Soar project from SVN:
  * http://soar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/msr
  * Check out to a new folder in Apps/QUT

Copy to bin folder from a running Soar installation or trunk:

{{{ 
CSharp_sml_ClientInterface.dll ElementXML.dll Java_SMLClientInterface.dll sml.jar smlCSharp.dll SoarJavaDebugger.jar SoarKernelSML.dll swt.jar
}}}

Open SoarMSRService solution and build

Run/Debug (F5) to start

Modify settings in `C:\Microsoft Robotics Studio (1.5)\Apps\QUT\Config\SoarMSR.Config.xml` after first run
  * That file is created on first run

== Configuration Settings ==
