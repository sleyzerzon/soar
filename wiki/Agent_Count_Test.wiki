= Counting Agent =
Agents that can count in nine different ways.  

The real purpose of this agent is to provide various test of Soar's execution:
  # Long runs
  # Lots of working memory
  # Various subgoals/impasses and results with chunking
  # Lots of chunks/results
  # Nasty conditions for chunking
  # Should find any memory leaks.
