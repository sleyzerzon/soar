= Tower of Hanoi Recursive Agent 2 =
This agent solves the Tower of Hanoi problems. This puzzle "involves three vertical pegs or posts and a number of doughnut-like disks of graduated sizes that fit  on the pegs. At the outset, all the disks are arranged pyramidally on one of the pegs, say A, with the largest disk on the bottom. The task is to move all of the disks to another peg, C, say, under the constraints that (1) only one disk may be moved at a time, and (2) a disk may never be placed on top of another smaller than itself. Any number of disks may be used; the minimum number of moves for a solution is (2**n - 1), where n is the number of disks" (Simon, 1975/1979, pp. 230-231).
