== Install the Prerequisites ==

=== Java Developers Package ===
*Who Needs It*: Everyone.

*Where is it*: 10.6 is the only one we support. You can find this at http://connect.apple.com/ under Java downloads.

*How to install*: Follow the instructions on the download page.
  * *Note*: If you get an error with "jni.h", visit the [http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2630649&tstart=0 following page] to see how to resolve it.

=== XCode ===
*Who Needs It*: Everyone.  XCode is the Mac OS development environment under which you'll build Soar.

*Where is it*: [http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/ XCode].

*How to install*: Follow the instructions on the download page.

=== SCons ===
*Who Needs It*: Everyone.  SCons is an enhanced version of Make.

*Where is it*: You must install SCons *version 1.x*.  Unfortunately, *SCons version 2.x does not work*. If you have 2.x installed, you can install 1.x over it, but this may break any applications that require 2.x. Download the tarball from the [http://www.scons.org/ SCons site].

*How to install*:
  # Open and extract the contents to a folder of your choice. 
  # Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted folder
  # Run:
{{{
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

=== Eclipse ===
*Who Needs It*: People who want to either (a) use the SoarEditor (an Eclipse-based Soar development environment) to build Soar agents or (b) build Java environments to interface with Soar.

*Where is it*: 
  * You can find it at [http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ download.eclipse.org].
  * Get the 64-bit *Carbon* version.

*How to install*: Drop it into your Applications folder or home folder.

== Set Up Environment Variables ==

To make these changes permenant, edit your `.bash_profile` file and put them at the bottom.

The binaries are installed to `SoarSuite/out` by default and need to be in the library path during execution, tell the loader where to look by setting:

{{{
# Note: your exact path will vary depending on the location of SoarSuite
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/$USER/soar/SoarSuite/out/lib
}}}

If you add the `SoarSuite/out/bin` file to the path, you can execute binaries from anywhere:

{{{
export PATH=$PATH=/home/$USER/sandbox/bin
}}}

Alternatively you can install things to a well-known location like `/usr/local`
though this is not recommended. Many users do have sandboxes in their home
directories, you can do that by using the `SOAR_HOME` variable:

{{{
export SOAR_HOME=/home/$USER/sandbox
export PATH=$PATH:/home/$USER/sandbox/bin
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/$USER/sandbox/lib
}}}

*Note for Eclipse users*: Eclipse will not inherit these environment variables unless you launch Eclipse from the shell. Alternatively [http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/EnvironmentVars.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002093-BCIJIJBH look here for other ways to get environment variables into Eclipse].
== Build Soar ==

Run `make` in the top-level folder, see the [FAQ] for common solutions to errors.
