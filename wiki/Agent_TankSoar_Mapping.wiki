= !TankSoar Mapping Agent =
This agent extends the capabilities of both the !TankSoar simple agent (described [Agent_TankSoar_Simple here]) and the !TankSoar simple sound agent (described [Agent_TankSoar_SimpleSound here]) with the ability to create an internal representation of the environment map.  It uses this map to better control its radar and find chargers.
