#summary Soar projects using April.

[http://april.eecs.umich.edu Edwin Olson's April group projects and libraries] are used with some Soar projects (currently Sproom).

= Setup Procedure =

  * Follow the [Build build] procedure to get Soar checked out and built.
    * Necessary components: Core, Java, Sproom (and/or other April-related projects).
    * Eclipse setup and usage is required to build (ant build scripts don't work yet).

  * Visit [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~soar/sitemaker/misc/april/ the secondary site hosting updated april jars] and download them to your output directory's `share/java` folder. Usually `SoarSuite/out/share/java` or `~/sandbox/share/java`.
    * The libraries currently posted on the April resources page are not as up to date as they need to be.

  * Download the JOGL zip file appropriate to you platform from [http://download.java.net/media/jogl/builds/archive/jsr-231-1.1.1a/ this JOGL builds folder].
    * Unzip and place jars in `share/java`, shared libraries (Linux/Mac) in `share/lib`, and DLLs (Windows) in `share/bin`.

  * Download [https://jinput.dev.java.net/ the latest jinput binaries from the jinput site].
    * Unzip and place jars in `share/java`, shared libraries (Linux/Mac) in `share/lib`, and DLLs (Windows) in `share/bin`.

  * If running outside of Eclipse, be sure to add all relevant jars to your classpath.


= Build =

*The ant build scripts have not been fully updated*. For now, use Eclipse. Set up Eclipse as outlined in [Build the build document]. Additionally:

  * Import the Sproom project in to the Eclipse workspace.

  * Set a few more build path variables:
    * `APRIL_MEGA`: Path to `april-mega.jar`
    * `GLUEGEN_RT`: Path to `gluegen-rt.jar`
    * `JOGL`: Path to `jogl.jar`
