#summary alias command documentation
= alias =

Define a new alias, or command, using existing commands and arguments.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
alias [name [cmd [args]]]
}}}

=== Default Aliases ===

|| `a` || `alias` ||

== Description ==

This command defines new aliases by creating Soar procedures with the given
name. The new procedure can then take an arbitrary number of arguments which
are post-pended to the given definition and then that entire string is executed
as a command. The definition must be a single command, multiple commands are
not allowed. The alias procedure checks to see if the name already exists, and
does not destroy existing procedures or aliases by the same name. Existing
aliases can be removed by using the [cmd_unalias unalias]
command. With no arguments, alias returns the list of defined aliases. With
only the name given, alias returns the current definition.

== Examples ==

The alias `wmes` is defined as:

{{{
alias wmes print -i
}}}

If the user executes a command such as:

{{{
wmes {(* ^superstate nil)}
}}}

... it is as if the user had typed this command:

{{{
print -i {(* ^superstate nil)}
}}}

To check what a specific alias is defined as, you would type

{{{
alias wmes
}}}
