#summary chunk-name-format command documentation
= chunk-name-format =

Specify format of the name to use for new chunks.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
chunk-name-format [-nrl] -p [prefix]
chunk-name-format [-nrl] -c [count]
}}}

== Options ==

|| `-n, --numbered` || Name chunks based on the order in which they were created ||
|| `-r, --rule` || Name chunks based on the rule that created the result (default) ||
|| `-l, --long` || Name chunks based on the impasse type that created the substate ||
|| `-p, --prefix [p]` || If given, use `p` as the prefix for naming chunks. Otherwise, return the current prefix. (defaults to _chunk_) ||
|| `-c, --count [c]` || If given, set the chunk counter for naming chunks to `c`. Otherwise, return the current value of the chunk counter. ||

== Description ==

The short format for naming newly-created chunks is: 

{{{
<prefix><chunknum>
}}}

The rule-based (default) format for naming chunks is:

{{{
<prefix>*<original-rule-name>*<short-impassetype>*<dc>-<dcChunknum>
}}}

The long format for naming chunks is:

{{{
<prefix>-<chunknum>-<dc>*<impassetype>*<dcChunknum>
}}}

where:
  * `prefix` is a user-definable prefix string; `prefix` defaults to _chunk_ when unspecified by the user. It many not contain the character `*`,
  * `original-rule-name` is the name of the production that produced the result that resulted in this chunk,
  * `chunknum` is a counter set by `--count` or starting at 1 for the first chunk created,
  * `dc` is the number of the decision cycle in which the chunk was formed,
  * `impassetype` is one of `tie`, `conflict`, `cfailure`, `snochange`, `opnochange`,
  * `short-impassetype` is one of `tie`, `con`, `cfi`, `snc`, `onc`,
  * `dcChunknum` is the number of the chunk within that specific decision cycle.

Note that when using the rule-based naming format, a chunk based on another chunk will have a name that beings with `prefix` followed by `-multi`, for example *`chunk-multi*apply-rule*42-2`*.
