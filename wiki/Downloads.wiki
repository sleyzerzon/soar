The most stable version of Soar is *9.3.0*.

This release of Soar includes modules for reinforcement learning
(introduced in 9.0), episodic memory (introduced in 9.1), and semantic
memory (introduced in 9.2), along with many new features and stability
updates. All learning mechanisms are now disabled by default.

Downloading and installing [http://java.sun.com Java] is recommended since most users will want to use the Soar Java Debugger and other Soar components written in Java. The [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp latest version of the Sun JRE or JDK] is recommended. 

_Important: the 64-bit Soar downloads require 64-bit Java!_
