#summary pwatch command documentation
= pwatch =

Trace firings and retractions of specific productions.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
pwatch [-d|e] [production name]
}}}

=== Default Aliases ===

|| `pw` || `pwatch` ||

== Options ==

|| `-d, --disable, --off` || Turn production watching off for the specified production. If no production is specified, turn production watching off for all productions. ||
|| `-e, --enable, --on` || Turn production watching on for the specified production. The use of this flag is optional, so this is pwatch's default behavior. If no production is specified, all productions currently being watched are listed. ||
|| `production name` || The name of the production to watch. ||

== Description ==

The pwatch command enables and disables the tracing of the firings and
retractions of individual productions. This is a companion command to
[cmd_watch watch], which cannot specify individual productions
by name.

With no arguments, pwatch lists the productions currently being traced. With
one production-name argument, pwatch enables tracing the production; `--enable`
can be explicitly stated, but it is the default action.

If `--disable` is specified followed by a production-name, tracing is turned
off for the production. When no production-name is specified, `--enable` lists
all productions currently being traced, and `--disable` disables tracing of all
productions.

Note that pwatch now only takes one production per command. Use multiple times
to watch multiple functions.
