= !SoarUnit = 
!SoarUnit is a framework for unit testing Soar code introduced in JSoar 0.10.1. It is implemented as part of JSoar, but it supports running code in either JSoar or CSoar 9.3.1. When run, !SoarUnit scans a given directory for test cases (see below) and runs all of the tests that are found. It then reports the test results, either in a text format, or through a user interface similar to the JUnit view in Eclipse.
