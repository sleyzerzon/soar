Empties working memory and resets run-time statistics.

== Description ==

The init-soar command initializes Soar. It removes all elements from working
memory, wiping out the goal stack, and resets all runtime statistics. The
firing counts for all productions are reset to zero. The init-soar command
allows a Soar program that has been halted to be reset and start its execution
from the beginning.

init-soar does not remove any productions from production memory; to do this,
use the [cmd_excise excise] command. Note however, that all
justifications will be removed because they will no longer be supported.
