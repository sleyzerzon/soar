#summary firing-counts command documentation
= firing-counts =

Print the number of times each production has fired.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
firing-counts [n]
firing-counts production_name
}}}

=== Default Aliases ===

|| `fc` || `firing-counts` ||

== Options ==

If given, an option can take one of two forms -- an integer or a production name:
|| `n` || List the top `n` productions. If `n` is 0, only the productions which haven't fired are listed ||
|| `production_name ` || Print how many times the production has fired ||

== Description ==

The firing-counts command prints the number of times each production has fired;
production names are given from most requently fired to least frequently fired.
With no arguments, it lists all productions. If an integer argument, `n`, is
given, only the top `n` productions are listed.  If `n` is zero (0), only the
productions that haven't fired at all are listed. If a production name is given
as an argument, the firing count for that production is printed.

Note that firing counts are reset by a call to [cmd_init_soar
init-soar].

== Examples ==

This example prints the 10 productions which have fired the most times along
with their firing counts:

{{{
firing-counts 10
}}}

This example prints the firing counts of production `my*first*production`:

{{{
firing-counts my*first*production
}}}

== Warnings ==

Firing-counts are reset to zero after an [cmd_init_soar
init-soar].

NB: This command is slow, because the sorting takes time `O(n*log n)`
