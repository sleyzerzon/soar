= Windows =

32-bit and 64-bit Windows platforms are supported for Windows XP, Vista, and 7.
Other versions of 32-bit windows might work but are not officially supported.

== Install the Prerequisities ==

  # *Microsoft Visual C++ compiler*
  There are several ways you can get this:
    * Visual Studio Professional or better. This includes both the 32 and 64 bit compilers and the full VS IDE. If you are on a 64-bit machine, make sure to explicitly choose to install the the 64-bit compiler. It is not installed by default.
    * [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14597 Visual C++ Express Edition]. Free, but only includes the 32 bit compiler, and a basic IDE.
    * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx Windows SDK]. Free, and includes both the 32 and 64 bit compilers, but no IDE.
    
    Note that because Soar is built by [http://scons.org SCons], you don't need the Visual Studio IDE or project configurations to build it. You only need the command-line compiler, linker, and runtime libraries.

  # *Java SE 6 JDK*
    * The latest Java SE 6 JDK is available from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Oracle's web site].  Make sure to download the 64-bit version, if you are on a 64-bit machine.
  # *SWIG*
    * SWIG acts as a bridge between the Soar C++ libraries and the various other languages, like Java, Tcl, Python, Perl. Since nearly everyone will need the Soar debugger, which is written in Java, this component is required.
    * You can download a precompiled zip from [http://www.swig.org/download.html swig.org] and extract it anywhere. We recommend `C:\swig` or a similar path without spaces, because the build script may have trouble with those.
  # *Python*
    * Soar uses the [scons.org SCons build system], which requires Python. Python version 2.7.2 is recommended, but anything from 2.5 onward should work. The Python 3.x series WILL NOT WORK.  You can download Python 2.7.2 from [http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/ python.org]. We recommend using the installer.
    * If you are planning on a debug build including Python, [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~soar/sitemaker/misc/python you will need Python debug libraries]. Save the correct one for your architecture in `Python26\libs`.
    * As with SWIG, please install Python to a path without spaces. If you use the installer from python.org, the default `C:\Python2X` is a good choice.

== Build Soar ==

Launch the Visual Studio Command Prompt (or WinSDK command prompt, if you installed that instead) from the start menu. Use `cd` to change to the `SoarSuite` directory, and type
{{{
  build all
}}}

The batch file may ask you for the paths to Java, SWIG, or Python, if it can't find them automatically. You no longer have to manually specify those paths in environment variables. After that it will run the included SCons scripts to build Soar. For more detailed information about the Scons script, see the [BuildSconsScript SCons Script Documentation page]. See the [FAQ] for common solutions to errors.

=== Visual Studio Solution Generation ===

SCons can generate Visual Studio project and solution files that allow users to more easily modify and debug the kernel source code.  When performing 'build all', these files will also be generated.  You can also manually generate these files by typing
{{{
  scons msvs
}}}
Note that the generated projects are not stand-alone, they still call SCons under the hood to build targets.
