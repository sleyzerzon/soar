= What is Soar? =

Soar is a general cognitive architecture for developing systems that exhibit intelligent behavior. Researchers all over the world are using Soar.

Visit the [http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar Soar home page] for news and general information about Soar. Many research papers and other publications are available on the [Publications Soar publications] page.

    * Abstract: One approach in pursuit of general intelligent agents has been to concentrate on the underlying cognitive architecture, of which Soar is a prime example. In the past, Soar has relied on a minimal number of architectural modules together with purely symbolic representations of knowledge. This paper presents the cognitive architecture approach to general intelligence and the traditional, symbolic Soar architecture. This is followed by major additions to Soar: nonsymbolic representations, new learning mechanisms, and long-term memories.
