= What is Soar? =

Soar is a general cognitive architecture for developing systems that exhibit intelligent behavior. Researchers all over the world, both from the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, are using Soar for a variety of tasks. It has been in use since 1983, evolving through many different versions to where it is now Soar, Version 9.
 
We intend ultimately to enable the Soar architecture to:
  * work on the full range of tasks expected of an intelligent agent, from highly routine to extremely difficult, open-ended problems
  * represent and use appropriate forms of knowledge, such as procedural, declarative, episodic, and possibly iconic
  * employ the full range of problem solving methods
  * interact with the outside world, and
  * learn about all aspects of the tasks and its performance on them.

In other words, our intention is for Soar to support all the capabilities required of a general intelligent agent.
