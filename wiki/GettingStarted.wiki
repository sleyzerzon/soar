#summary Getting started with Soar

The easiest way to get started with Soar is to read through the Soar Tutorial
and to do all of the exercises. Although it's tempting to skip the exercises,
they're very useful and even fun. This page will walk you through the steps
necessary to get you up and running with Soar.

== Step 1: Download Soar ==

Download the latest version of Soar from [Downloads the download page]. Be sure
to install the appropriate version of Java for your system (32-bit downloads
will not work with 64-bit Java virtual machines and vice versa).

== Step 2: Start reading the tutorial ==

Check out the tutorial documents (parts 1 through 6) in the
`SoarSuite/Documentation` directory of the Soar project. Also included in the
documentation directory is the Soar manual. The Soar manual is not required for
the tutorial but is a handy reference.

The [http://www.adobe.com/ Adobe Reader] is needed to view the tutorial and
much of our other documentation (.pdf format).
