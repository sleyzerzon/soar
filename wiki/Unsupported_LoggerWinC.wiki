= C++ Logger = 
This project contains an example of a C++ program that interfaces with Soar.

This application shows an example of how to build a simple logging tool.  To use it you would run a Soar kernel somewhere (in an environment or inside the debugger for example) and then run this logger.  The logger listens for certain events and then creates a log file.

The idea is that you could take this simple app and modify it to log what you need for your specific application, outputing the data in whatever format you want.
