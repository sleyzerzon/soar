= Arithmetic Agent with Semantic Memory =
This agent demonstrates the use of semantic memory by extending the capabilities of the [Agent_Arithmetic Arithmetic Agent].  The description of that agent also applies here.

This agent supports using semantic memory through in three different ways controlled by parameters set in initialize-arithmetic. 
  # If the semantic or working memory is pre-loaded with problems, it will use those problems. If not it will generate problems at random.  
    * problems-5000.soar and problems-10000.soar contain the rules to generate the working memory problems. 
    * problems-5000-smem.soar contains the structure to initialize semantic memory.
    * Controlled by loading one of those files at run time and setting {{{^parameters.problems-source [wm smem]}}}
  # Control whether arithmetic facts are computed/stored in working memory or semantic memory. If in semantic memory, will dynamically generated using counting (process-column/compute-result/add-via-counting
    * Controlled by parameters.fact-source {{{[wm smem]}}}
    * To experiment with impact of semantic memory, can control whether facts are stored in semantic memory (or will always be counted) via parameters.store {{{[yes no]}}} and whether they are attempted to be retrieved parameters.retrieve {{{[yes no]}}}
    * Number of problems attempted is set by count, which is usually 5000 or 10000.
