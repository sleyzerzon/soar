#summary max-goal-depth command documentation
= max-goal-depth =

Limit the sub-state stack depth.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
max-goal-depth [n]
}}}

== Options ==

|| `n` || Maximum depth of sub-states allowed. ||

== Description ==

The max-goal-depth command is used to limit the maximum depth of sub-states. 
The initial value of this variable is 100; allowable settings are any integer greater than 0.

This limit is included in Soar to prevent getting stuck in an infinite recursive loop, which
may come about due to deliberate actions or via an agent bug, such as dropping inadvertently 
to state-no-change impasses.
