#summary max-dc-time command documentation
= max-dc-time =

Set a wall-clock time limit such that the agent will be interrupted when a single decision cycle exceeds this limit.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
max-dc-time [--seconds] [n]
max-dc-time -d
}}}

== Options ==

|| `n` || Maximum decision cycle time in *microseconds* ||
|| `-d`, `--disable` || Disable this interrupt. ||
|| `-s`, `--seconds` || Interpret n as seconds (floating point OK) ||

== Description ==

After output phase, the elapsed decision cycle time is checked to see if it 
is greater than the old maximum, and the maximum dc time stat is updated (see [cmd_stats stats]). At this time, this threshold is also checked. If met or exceeded,
Soar stops at the end of the current output phase with an interrupted state.

== Examples ==

{{{
max-dc-time -s 0.05
max-dc-time 4000
}}}
