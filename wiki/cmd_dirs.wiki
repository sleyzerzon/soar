#summary dirs command documentation
= dirs =

List the directory stack.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
dirs
}}}

== Description ==

This command lists the directory stack. Agents can move through a directory
structure by pushing and popping directory names. The dirs command returns the
stack.

The command [cmd_pushd pushd] places a new "agent current
directory" on top of the directory stack and changes to it. The command
[cmd_popd popd] removes the directory at the top of the
directory stack and changes to the previous directory which now appears at the
top of the stack.
