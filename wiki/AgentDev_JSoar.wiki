JSoar is a pure Java implementation of Soar. Soar is a general cognitive architecture for developing systems that exhibit intelligent behavior.

There are a few benefits to a pure-Java implementation of Soar:
  * Idiomatic Java API in contrast to CSoar's SWIG-generated bindings.
  * "Free" multi-language support (JRuby, Jython, Rhino (JavaScript), Groovy, Scala, Clojure, etc)
  * A codebase and tools more friendly to rapid research prototyping
  * No native libraries to deal with
  * Cleaner integration with "enterprisey" systems
