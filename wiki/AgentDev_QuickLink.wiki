= !QuickLink Input Simulator = 

The purpose of this tool is to give complete control of the input-link to the Soar programmer. !QuickLink can be thought of as a way to "fake" an external application, such as a game or simulation, in order to test specific circumstances that are rare and/or hard to reproduce. !QuickLink currently can only be operated through the use of a command line interface.
