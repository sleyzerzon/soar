= Blocks-World Look-Ahead Agent with Reinforcement Learning =
This agent contains a version of blocks-world that involves one level of problem spaces and look-ahead but with two important extensions. It demonstrates how RL-rules can be learned by chunking and then updated in the future. The advantage over simple lookahead is that it doesn't lock on to the one path found during look-ahead after chunking. It will still do some exploration.
