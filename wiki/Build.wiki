#summary Checkout and build procedure

= Windows =

32-bit and 64-bit Windows platforms are supported for Windows XP and Vista. Other versions of 32-bit windows might work but are not officially supported.

== Prerequisites ==

Either Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition is required to build Soar. 
  * Install Visual Studio 2008 if you have access to it, or download and install Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition from [http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/ microsoft.com]. 

SWIG is recommended, or required if any of the language interfaces are used (such as Java, Python, or Tcl).
  * Download the latest version of *swigwin* from [http://www.swig.org/download.html swig.org].
  * Extract anywhere, such as your home folder or `C:\` or `C:\Program Files`.

Java is recommended for most users, as most of the Soar tools and environments are written in Java.
  * Download and install the latest Java SE 6 JDK from [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp java.sun.com].
    * If targeting 64-bit, download the 64-bit version of the JDK.

The Apache Ant build system is required if using Java applications.
  * Download ant from [http://ant.apache.org/ ant.apache.org].
  * Extract anywhere, such as your home folder or `C:\` or `C:\Program Files`.

Eclipse is recommended if doing Java development.
  * Download the latest version of Eclipse from [http://eclipse.org eclipse.org]
    * If targeting 64-bit, download the 64-bit version of Eclipse, found on [http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ download.eclipse.org].
  * Extract anywhere you have write permissions without authentication, such as your home folder. System folders (such as `C:\Program Files`) are not recommended locations for Eclipse.

A Subversion client is required. The Soar group at U of M mainly uses TortoiseSVN and/or Subclipse (within Eclipse).
  * Download and install TortoiseSVN from [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads tortoisesvn.net].
  * Install Subclipse if you're using Eclipse by visiting the Help -> Install new software  dialog and adding the site `http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x`.
    * If targeting 64-bit, you may need to install (the 64-bit version of) SlikSVN to get Subclipse to work correctly, available at [http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download/ sliksvn.com]. Eclipse may need to be restarted to see the SlikSVN libraries.

Python 2.6 is recommended, or required if the Python SML interface is desired. Other versions of Python will not work "out of the box."
  * Download and install Python *2.6* from [http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/ python.org].

Tcl/Tk is optional, or required if the Tcl SML interface is desired.
  * Download and install Tcl/Tk *8.4* from [http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads/ activestate.com]
