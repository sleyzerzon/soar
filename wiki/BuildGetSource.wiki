= Getting the Source =

There are two ways to get the source code:
  # Download the the [http://soar.googlecode.com/files/SoarSuite-9.3.2-source.tar.gz 9.3.2 platform-independent source].  This will contain the last major release of the entire !SoarSuite.
  # Checkout the latest code directly from the Soar SVN repository.

If you chose the first option and manually downloaded the full !SoarSuite, skip down to your operating system notes below:

  * [BuildWindows Windows Build Notes]
  * [BuildLinux Linux Build Notes]
  * [BuildMac Mac OS X Build Notes]

Otherwise, follow the instructions in the next section to download Soar from the SVN repository.

== How to Check Out Soar from SVN ==

  # Install a subversion client (a revision control program that allows you to download the Soar source code from the SVN repository)
    ** *Windows*: get [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads TortoiseSVN] (GUI) and/or [http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download SlikSVN] (command line).
    ** *Ubuntu Linux*: Install package `subversion`.  You can use the command {{{sudo apt-get install subversion}}}.
    ** *Mac*: Do nothing! Subversion ships with Leopard and newer.
  # Check out `SoarSuite`
    ** The URL for the repository is *http://soar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SoarSuite/ * (if you are a Soar developer affiliated with the U of M and plan to check in changes, use *https:// *)
      ** *Command-line SVN program*: Use the command `svn checkout http://soar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SoarSuite`
      ** *TortoiseSVN (Windows)*: Right click in the folder that you want to install the SoarSuite in and select "Checkout". A [http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-checkout.html checkout dialog box] will appear. Enter the URL for the repository as given above.
    ** *Note*:  Your username is your Google account name without the `@` or domain. [http://code.google.com/hosting/settings Your password is your googlecode.com password].
