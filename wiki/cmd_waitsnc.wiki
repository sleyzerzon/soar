#summary waitsnc command documentation
= waitsnc =

Generate a wait state rather than a state-no-change impasse.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
wait -[e|d]
}}}

== Options ==

|| `-e, --enable, --on` || Turns a state-no-change into a `wait` state. ||
|| `-d, --disable, --off` || Default. A state-no-change generates an impasse. ||

== Description ==

In some systems, espcially those that model expert (fully chunked) knowledge, a
state-no-change may represent a _wait state_ rather than an impasse.  The
waitsnc command allows the user to switch to a mode where a state-no-change
that would normally generate an impasse (and subgoaling), instead generates a
_wait_ state. At a _wait_ state, the decision cycle will repeat (and the
decision cycle count is incremented) but no _state-no-change_ impasse (and
therefore no substate) will be generated.

When issued with no arguments, waitsnc returns its current setting.
