= PHP Example Project = 
This project contains an example PHP project that interfaces with Soar. It includes a sample agent that is a slight modification of the water-jug-rl demo agent included with Soar.  The main difference is that the initialization application and the goal-detection elaboration rules condition upon server-side input-link structures to dynamically generate water-jug problem instances.

For the PHP bindings to build correctly, SWIG Version 1.3.40 is required.

For Soar to interact with PHP, there are a couple manual steps:

1. Open php.ini and set the enable_dl = On
2. Copy (or, preferably, create a symbolic link) of libPHP_sml_ClientInterface.so (in lib) to the PHP extension_dir (sans the lib prefix).
   This is visible via phpInfo() (search for extension_dir) or `php-config --extension-dir`.


For Soar to work with Apache via PHP, there are another couple steps:

1. The module needs to be loaded by default.
   Open php.ini, add extension=PHP_sml_!ClientInterface.so (at the end of the list of extensions).

2. The SML shared library (i.e. libSoarKernelSML) needs to be accessible to Apache.
   Easiest way: copy the library to system library path (like /usr/local/lib).
