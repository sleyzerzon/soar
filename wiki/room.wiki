#summary Room environment notes.
#labels Phase-Support

Note: This help refers to the trunk and future releases, and is not included with the latest round of Soar releases (9.0.1, 9.1.1, 9.2.0).

The Room environment is included in the soar-java/soar-soar2d folder in the Soar suite.

See configuration help on the [Soar2D Soar2D help page]. Here is an example:

{{{
general.game = "room";
general.map = "config/maps/room/default.txt";
players.active_players = [ "robot" ];
players.robot.productions = "agents/room/simple-robot.soar";
}}}

= I/O =
Strikeout denotes not implemented.

== Output link specification ==

A note about status error: most commands that return with status error will have an error message attached for debugging. Example, `<m>` below could contain `set-velocity: Unable to parse linear-velocity`

{{{
<s> ^io.output-link.set-velocity <sv>
<sv> ^status error ^message <m>
}}}

=== Drive Commands ===

Only *one* of the drive commands can be issued at a time. If more than one command is issued, the system arbitrarily picks one unless one of them is _estop_, which overrides all other drive commands.

All parameters for the command must be on the same identifier of the command. For example:

{{{
<s> ^io.output-link.set-velocity <sv>
<sv> ^linear-velocity 1. ^angular velocity 1.
}}}
