= Water Jug Tie Agent (Look-Ahead with State Evaluation) =

This agent is a modification of the [Agent_WJ_Simple Water Jug Simple Agent] that demonstrates using a tie impasse to subgoal and evaluate operators.  This is an excellent demonstration of look-ahead search and how the selection default rules work.

Unlike the [Agent_WJ_LookAhead Water Jug Look-Ahead Agent], the tie agent has knowledge that prefers certain moves over others, for example preferring a pour after a fill operator, so it is able to solve the problem much more efficiently.
