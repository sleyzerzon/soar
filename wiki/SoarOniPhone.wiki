#summary Soar on the iPhone OS

= Introduction =

This page will guide you through the process of having a Soar-enabled application on the iPhone OS. Here are the basic steps, with more detail below:

  # Add Soar includes to the XCode header search path
  # Add static Soar libraries to the XCode project
  # Rename appropriate source files to .mm (to enable C++)
  # Include the appropriate headers in your source

= Soar Includes =

The easiest way to do this is to download a release and point XCode to the "include" directory. The location of this option is... Project -> Edit Project Settings -> Build -> Header Search Paths (under Search Paths group).

= Soar Static Libraries =

The basic process is to compile Soar statically for an iPhone-specific architecture and SDK:

  # Checkout Core from SVN
  # Modify Core/SConstruct compilation to match the following compiler/linker flags: '-m32 -arch i386 -isysroot /path/to/sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.5' (basically what XCode uses for your app)
  # Compile statically: scons --static --platform=32

All lib`a`.a files in the out/lib folder should be added to your project (drag+drop).

= Rename Source Files =

XCode allows you to use C++ if your source file is named with a .mm (vs. .m) extension. This will make for the easiest transition for non-Objective-C programmers.

= Include Headers =

In addition to the usual SML headers:

  * sml_Connection.h
  * sml_Client.h
  * ElementXML.h

XCode needs one more:

  * portability.h
