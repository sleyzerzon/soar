= Soar on iOS =

This project demonstrates how you can run a Soar-enabled application on an iOS device like an iPhone or iPad.

=== Downloads ===

  * [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~soar/sitemaker/misc/Soar931-iOS43.tar.gz Soar931-iOS43]: Contains all include files from the 9.3.1 release, as well as built libraries for the iOS simulator, armv6, and armv7 architectures. It has been tested with iOS 4.3.

  * [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~soar/sitemaker/misc/ios-example.tar.gz iSoar]: A self-contained sample application that works out-of-the-box on the iOS simulator (it has copies of the includes and simulator libs from the previous link).

=== Documentation ===
Here are the basic steps, with more detail below:

  # Add Soar includes to the XCode header search path
  # Add static Soar libraries to the XCode project
  # Rename appropriate source files to .mm (to enable C++)
  # Include the appropriate headers in your source

==== Soar Includes ====

The easiest way to do this is to download a release and point XCode to the "include" directory. In Build Path, look for "Header Search Paths".

==== Soar Static Libraries ====

The basic process is to compile Soar statically for an iPhone-specific architecture and SDK:

  # Checkout Core from SVN
  # `make ios-simulator` or `make ios-armv6` or `make ios-armv7`

All lib`*`.a files in the out/lib folder should be added to your project (drag+drop), except for SQLite.

==== Rename Source Files ====

XCode allows you to use C++ if your source file is named with a .mm (vs. .m) extension. This will make for the easiest transition for non-Objective-C programmers.

==== Include Headers ====

In addition to the usual SML headers:

  * sml_Connection.h
  * sml_Client.h
  * ElementXML.h

XCode needs one more, which must go before the others:

  * portability.h
