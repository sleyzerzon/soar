#summary o-support-mode command documentation
= o-support-mode =

Choose experimental variations of o-support.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
o-support-mode [n]
}}}

== Options ==

|| `3` || Mode 3 is the same as mode 2 except that operator elaborations (adding attributes to operators) now get i-support even though you have to test the operator to elaborate an operator. In cases where the rule mixes support types, support defaults to o-support (and a warning is printed). ||
|| `4` || Mode 4 is the default. It is the same as mode 3 except where a rule mixes support types, support defaults to i-support (and a warning is still printed). ||

== Description ==

The o-support-mode command is used to control the way that o-support is
determined for preferences. Only o-support modes 3 & 4 are valid (other modes
require Soar 7, which is no longer supported). O-support mode 4 should be
considered an improved version of mode 3. The default o-support mode is mode 4.

In o-support modes 3 & 4, support is given production by production; that is,
all preferences generated by the RHS of a single instantiated production will
have the same support. The difference between the two modes is in how they
handle productions with both operator and non-operator augmentations on the
RHS. For more information on o-support calculations, see the relevant appendix
in the Soar manual.

Running o-support-mode with no arguments prints out the current o-support-mode.
