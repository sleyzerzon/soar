= Tower of Hanoi No Operators Agent =
This agent uses mutually exclusive elaboration to solve the problem in a single decision.  This is *not* the way to write Soar programs, but is provided as an interesting example.  The general description of the task from the [Agent_ToH_Simple Simple Tower of Hanoi Agent] still applies.
