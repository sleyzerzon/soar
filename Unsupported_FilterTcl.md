# FilterTcl #

FilterTcl demonstrates how to write a client that intercepts commands to allow one to use Tcl from the command line (like earlier versions of Soar).

To demonstrate its capabilities, it comes packaged with both TclEaters and the TSI (Tcl Soar Interface, i.e. the old Tcl-based Soar debugger.)
