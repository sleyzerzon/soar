# Agents #

In this category, you'll find a variety of agents developed for a wide range of different tasks and environments.  You will find a full description of the agent, its capabilities and problem solving approach as well, as a download link.  If the agent requires an environment, a link will be provided.

We'd highly encourage you to submit your own agents for use by the greater Soar community.  To do so, you can send your zipped up submission with a full description (try to include all of the type of information we include on each download page) to mazina@umich.edu with the subject "Soar Agent Submission".
