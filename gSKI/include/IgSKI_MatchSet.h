    * @brief Handles sets of matches.
    *
    * Each Match is associated with a Condition, so the Match structure
    * needs to be represented in much the same way as the Condition
    * structure.
    *
    * @see IConditionSet
    *
    * The recursive nature of this definition of IMatchSet is due to
    * negated Match sets which can contain negated Match sets which
    * can contain negated Match sets etc. etc. etc.  <p>
    *
    * At each "level" of the condition, you can retrieve the list of 
    * single matches at that "level", or the list of negated matchSets
    * for that same "level".
    *
    * The structure used for handling Matches works very similarly
    * to the way that the ConditionSet structure works.  The main
    * difference revolves around the fact that there can be many 
    * matches to a single Condition.
    *
    * @see ConditionSet
    *
    * A MatchSet is a single match against a Condition.  Each top-level
    * MatchSet represents a single match!
    *
    * @code
    * Example:
    *  >A---------------------------------------------------------<
    *   >B--------------------------------------------------------<
    *     *  *  >C----<  >D----------------------------------<   *
    *             *  *     *  *  >E----<  >%-< >%----------<
    *                              *  *     *     *   *   *
    *  -{c1 c2 -{c3 c4} -{c5 c6 -{c7 c8} -{c9} {c10 c11 c12} } c13}
    *
    *      >-...-<   ==> MatchSet
    *      *         ==> Individual Condition Match
    *      [A-Z]     ==> MatchSet Identifier
    *      %         ==> Simplification to non-Set.
    *
    * becomes:
    *
    *    MatchSet
    *       Matches   -> none
    *       MatchSets -> 1
    *       ---MatchSet[A]
    *          Matches   -> none
    *          MatchSets -> 1
