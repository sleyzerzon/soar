;;;; This file contains the core game description for BUILD.  Rules, facts and 
;;;; persistants for specific game instances appear in other files. Appending
;;;; the file for a game instance to this file will produce a complete, 
;;;; playable game description.
;;;;
;;;; Basic Assumptions and Rules:
;;;; 1)  Environment is two dimensional, with origin in lower left corner.
;;;;
;;;; 2)  All primitive objects are rectangular or square. 
;;;;
;;;; 3)  The weight and strength (ability to support weight) of a primitive
;;;;     depends on its size and material. To assure consistancy, the initial
;;;;     weight of primitives should be set by selecting a "weight factor" for
;;;;     for each material, and then multiplying that factor by the area of
;;;;     the primitive.  Likewise, the strength of a primitive is determined
;;;;     by multiplying the specified "strength factor" by the width of the
;;;;     primitive.
;;;;
;;;; 4)  Braces and reinforcements increase object weight additively, and
;;;;     increase object strength multiplicitively. An object may be braced
;;;;     multiple times, but reinforced only once. There is only one type of
;;;;     brace available for any given material, but there may be multiple
;;;;     types of reinforcement available.
;;;;
;;;; 5)  Braces and reinforcements are not manipulable objects. The agent
;;;;     has a fixed number of each available at the start of the game.
;;;;
;;;; 6)  Any primitive object bearing weight > strength causes collapse.
;;;;
;;;; 7)  The weight of a primitive, P1, and the objects supported by P1 is 
;;;;     distributed evenly among the primitives that support P1.
;;;;
;;;; 8)  Compound objects are formed from sets of connected objects.
;;;;
;;;; 9)  Compounds form strict heirarchies. Only objects (primitive or 
;;;;     compound) that are not already a members of another compound may
;;;;     be added to, or used to start, a compound.
;;;;
;;;; 10) Compounds are permanent (cannot be broken).
;;;;
;;;; 11) Any primitive object (including members of compounds) not directly 
;;;;     supported by another object will cause collapse.
;;;;
;;;; Actions:
;;;; * (add-to-compound ?compound ?object)
;;;;     Effects: 
;;;;     * ?object becomes a member of ?compound
;;;;     * The object-location and object-size of ?compound may change 
;;;;     Requirements:
;;;;     * ?compound already exists
;;;;     * ?compound is not a member of ?object's compound hierarchy
;;;;     * ?object is not a member of any other compound
;;;;     * Some member of ?object (or ?object itself if primitive) is
;;;;       touching some member of ?compound 
;;;;
;;;; * (brace ?object1 ?object2 ?brace-type)
;;;;     Effects: 
;;;;     * The joint between ?object1 and ?object2 is braced by ?brace-type
;;;;     * The object-size (weight) of ?object1 and ?object2 each increase
;;;;       by 1/2 the weight of ?brace-type
;;;;     * The weight of any compound above ?object1 and ?object2 in the 
;;;;       hierarchy increases by the weight of ?brace-type
;;;;     * The number of ?brace-type available is decreased by one
;;;;     * The strength of ?object1 and ?object2 are multiplied by the 
;;;;       strength of ?brace-type
;;;;     Requirements:
;;;;     * ?object1 and ?object are members of the same compound
;;;;     * ?object1 and ?object2 are primitives of the same material
;;;;     * ?brace-type is an appropriate material for bracing ?object1
;;;;       and ?object2
;;;;     * ?brace-type has count greater than 0
;;;;     * ?object1 and ?object2 form a joint (L-shaped or T-shaped)
;;;;     * ?object1 and ?object2 have not already been braced
;;;;
;;;; * (make-new-compound ?object)
;;;;     Effects:
;;;;     * A new compound object is created, with unique identifier
;;;;     * ?object is a member of the new compound
;;;;     * The new compound has the same location and size as ?object
;;;;     Requirements
;;;;     * ?object is an existing object (primitive or compound)
;;;;     * ?object is not a member of any other compound
;;;;
;;;; * (nudge ?object ?side)
;;;;     Effects:
;;;;     * ?object moves one unit toward ?side
;;;;     Requirements
;;;;     * ?object must weigh less than "max-movable-weight"
;;;;     * Nothing is stacked on top of ?object
;;;;     * ?object is not a member of any compound
;;;;     * ?object does not intersect any other primitive object once moved
;;;;     * ?side must be "left" or "right"
;;;;
;;;; * (place-adjacent ?object1 ?object2 ?side)
;;;;     Effects:
;;;;     * ?object2 is placed adjacent to (touching) ?object1's ?side.
;;;;       If ?side=top, then ?object2 is centered on top of ?object1 
;;;;       (failure if it won't fit).  If ?side=left or right, then the
;;;;       lowest available support is selected such that ?object1 and ?
;;;;       object2 touch (failure if none exists). ?side=bottom not allowed.
;;;;     * ?object2's location is changed
;;;;     * If ?object2 is compound, the locations of all members of the 
;;;;       compound hierarchy are appropriately updated
;;;;     Requirements:
;;;;     * ?object1 and ?object2 are not members of any compound
;;;;     * Nothing is stacked on top of ?object2
;;;;     * ?object2 must weigh less than "max-movable-weight"
;;;;     * There is some object available to support ?object2
;;;;     * ?object2's new location is different from the old
;;;;     * ?object2 does not intersect any other primitive once moved
;;;;
;;;; * (reinforce ?object ?reinforcement-type)
;;;;     Effects:
;;;;     * ?object is reinforced with ?reinforcement-type
;;;;     * ?object's weight increases by weight of ?reinforcement-type
;;;;     * The weight of any compound above ?object in the hierarchy
;;;;       increases by the weight of ?reinforcement-type
;;;;     * ?object's strength is multiplied by that of ?reinforcement-type
;;;;     Requirements:
;;;;     * ?reinforcement-type is an appropriate material for ?object
;;;;     * ?object has not already been reinforced
;;;;     * ?reinforcement-type has count greater than 0
;;;;
;;;; * (rotate ?object)
;;;;     Effects:
;;;;     * The width and height dimensions of ?object are exchanged
;;;;     Requirements:
;;;;     * ?object is primitive
;;;;     * ?object is not of type "ground"
;;;;     * ?object is not a member of any compound
;;;;     * ?object does not intersect any primitive after rotation
;;;;
