;;;; Goal:
;;;;   Construct a tower at least 9 units high by first constructing an arch 
;;;;   5 units high, then stacking two blocks on top of it. The blocks at the 
;;;;   bottom of the are must be reinforced to prevent collapse. There is only
;;;;   one solution structure for this problem, as there are not enough
;;;;   blocks to allow for a taller arch, and a shorter arch would no longer 
;;;;   meet the basic requirements in the goal definition.

;;;; **************************************************************************
;;;;
;;;; Basic Assumptions and Rules:
;;;; 1)  Environment is two dimensional, with origin in lower left corner.
;;;;
;;;; 2)  All objects are rectangular or square.
;;;;
;;;; 3)  The weight and strength (ability to support weight) of an object
;;;;     depends on its size and material. To assure consistancy, the initial
;;;;     weight of an object should be set by selecting a "weight factor" for
;;;;     for each material, and then multiplying that factor by the area of
;;;;     the object.  Likewise, the strength of an object is determined by
;;;;     multiplying the specified "strength factor" by the width of the
;;;;     object.
;;;;
;;;; 4)  Reinforcements increase object weight additively, and increase object
;;;;     strength multiplicitively. An object may be reinforced only once.
;;;;     There may be multiple types of reinforcement available to a given
;;;;     material.
;;;;
;;;; 5)  Reinforcements are not manipulable objects. The agent has a fixed
;;;;     number of reinforcements available at the start of the game.
;;;;
;;;; 6)  Any object bearing weight > strength causes collapse.
;;;;
;;;; 7)  The weight of an object, P1, along with the weights of the objects 
;;;;     supported by P1, is distributed evenly among the objects that support 
;;;;     P1.
;;;;
;;;; 8)  Any object not directly supported by another object will cause 
;;;;     collapse.
;;;;
;;;; 9)  A tower is defined as any vertical stack of two or more non-ground
;;;;     objects, and is identified by the top-most object in the stack.
;;;;     The height of a tower is defined as the difference between the 
;;;;     y-coordinate of the top-most object, and the y-coordinate of the 
;;;;     bottom-most object.
;;;;
;;;; 10) A pyramid is defined as any stacking of non-ground objects such that
;;;;     every object is on top of two supporting objects. The supporting
;;;;     objects must be adjacent to each other, have combined width greater
;;;;     than that of the upper object, and either rest on the ground, or be
;;;;     pyramids themselves. The height of a pyramid is defined as the
;;;;     difference between the y-coordinate of the top-most object, and the
;;;;     y-coordinate of the bottom-most object.
;;;;
;;;; 11) An arch is defined as any single object (the span) supported by two 
;;;;     non-adjacent towers. The height of an arch is defined as the sum of
;;;;     the tower height and the span height.
;;;;
;;;; Actions:
;;;; * (place-adjacent ?object1 ?object2 ?side)
;;;;     Effects:
;;;;     * ?object2 is moved such that it touches ?object1's ?side.
;;;;       If ?side=top, then ?object2's left side is aligned with the
;;;;       left side of ?object1.  If ?side=left or right, then the lowest
;;;;       available support is selected such that ?object1 and ?object2
;;;;       touch (failure if none exists). ?side=bottom is not allowed.
;;;;     Requirements:
;;;;     * Nothing is stacked on top of ?object2
;;;;     * ?object2 must weigh less than "max-movable-weight"
;;;;     * There is some object available to support ?object2
;;;;     * ?object2's new location is different from the old
;;;;     * ?object2 does not intersect any other object once moved
;;;;
;;;; * (reinforce ?object ?reinforcement-type)
;;;;     Effects:
;;;;     * ?object is reinforced with ?reinforcement-type
;;;;     * ?object's weight increases by weight of ?reinforcement-type
;;;;     * The weight of any compound above ?object in the hierarchy
;;;;       increases by the weight of ?reinforcement-type
;;;;     * ?object's strength is multiplied by that of ?reinforcement-type
;;;;     Requirements:
;;;;     * ?reinforcement-type is an appropriate material for ?object
;;;;     * ?object has not already been reinforced
;;;;     * ?reinforcement-type has count greater than 0
