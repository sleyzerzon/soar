   'select - Force the next selected operator

                                    Synopsis

 select <id>

                                    Options

   If no "id" is supplied, currently "select"ed operator (if applicable) is
   displayed

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |id|operator id of the operator to be selected in the next decision phase|
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

                                  Description

   The select command will force the selection of an operator, whose id is
   supplied as an argument, during the next decision phase. If the argument
   is not a proposed operator in the next decision phase, an error is raised
   and operator selection proceeds as if the select command had not been
   called. Otherwise, the supplied operator will be selected as the next
   operator, regardless of preferences. If select is called with no id
   argument, the command returns the operator id currently forced for
   selection (by a previous call to select), if one exists.

                                    Examples

   Assuming operator "O2" is a valid operator, this would select it as the
   next operator to be selected:

 select O2

   After this command, issuing just "select" will get "O2" as a return:

 select
