#This is a modification of the simple-bot from the Soar tutorial.
#The find-energy subgoal has been added to use episodic memory 
#to find the energy charger.

#This version is designed to follow N-step paths.

#This is my attempt to replace the ^energy-path structs with actual chunks.  
#The result is something that only chunks over direct paths to the energy
#charger.  Multiple step paths require that I record some semantic knowledge
#indicating which squares I know how to reach the charger from so I can use
#those squares as intermediate goals.
