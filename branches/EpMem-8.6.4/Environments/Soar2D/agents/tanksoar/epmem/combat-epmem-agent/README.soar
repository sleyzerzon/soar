##13 Oct 06 -----> heurll-epmem-bot3
##
##This bot is an alternative implementation of
##bot2 that keeps track of the effectiveness 
##of a memory at predicting rather than 
##averaging multiple memories.  (However, 
##the other functionality is left in.)

##After many many tweaks I have an agent that 
##outperforms simple bot.  This agent forms the base
##for several experiments to find the impact of
##removing and adding various functionality.
