Mac:
The following environment variables need to be set on OSX:

    JAVA_HOME="/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home"

    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/full/path/to/SoarSuite/SoarLibrary/lib

    SCONS_LIB_DIR=/Library/scons-0.98.0


A good place to put these is ~/.bash_profile
