                                    Options

   production_name The name of the production to edit.

                                  Description

   If an editor (currently limited to Visual Soar) is open and connected to
   Soar, this command causes the editor to open the file containing this
   production and move the cursor to the start of the production. If there is
   no editor connected to Soar, the command does nothing. In order to connect
   Visual Soar to Soar, launch Visual Soar and choose Connect from the Soar
   Runtime menu. Then open the Visual Soar project that you're working on. At
   that point, you're set up and edit-production will start to work.
