The initial value of this variable is 50; allowable settings are any integer greater than 0. <p>The chunking process will end after <b>max-chunks</b> chunks have been created, <i>even if there are more results that have not been backtraced through to create chunks</i>, and Soar will proceed to the next phase. A warning message is printed to notify the user that the limit has been reached. <p>This limit is included in Soar to prevent getting stuck in an infinite loop during the chunking process. This could conceivably happen because newly-built chunks may match immediately and are fired immediately when this happens; this can in turn lead to additional chunks being formed, etc. If you see this warning, something is seriously wrong; Soar is unable to guarantee consistency of its internal structures. You should not continue execution of the Soar program in this situation; stop and determine whether your program needs to build more chunks or whether you've discovered a bug (in your program or in Soar itself). </div></div></div><div class="visualClear"></div></div></body></html>
