   The predict command determines, based upon current operator proposals,
   which operator will be chosen during the next decision phase. If predict
   determines an operator tie will be encountered, "tie" is returned. If
   predict determines no operator will be selected (state no-change), "none"
   is returned. If predict determines a conflict will arise during the
   decision phase, "conflict" is returned. If predict determines a constraint
   failure will occur, "constraint" is returned. Otherwise, predict will
   return the id of the operator to be chosen. If operator selection will
   require probabilistic selection, and no alterations to the probabilities
   are made between the call to predict and decision phase, predict will
   manipulate the random number generator to enforce its prediction.
