                                  Description

   gp-max is used to limit the number of productions produced by a gp
   production. It is easy to write a gp production that has a combinatorial
   explosion and hangs for a long time while those productions are added to
   memory. The gp-max command bounds this. Use without an argument to query
   the current value.

                                    Examples

 gp-max 1000

   gp productions that produce more than 1000 productions will stop producing
   them when 1000 are made and return an error.
