= Soar Manual Generation =

  * Check out the latest Documentation source from SVN
    * The Soar User's Manual is found under SoarSuite/Documentation
    * Source files are in laTex under Documentation/ManualSource
    * The commandline interface pages for the User Interface section are generated by script from the Soar Wiki.  This script needs to be run to put the latest versions in SoarLibrary/CLIHelp.   Use the `*.tex` files to _guide_ your update of interface-8.6.tex.  Blindly pasting them in could result in errors in the manual.  Be sure to preview.
  * Edit the User Manual laTex files using your favorite text editor.  Emacs does a lovely job with latex.
  * Under linux, follow the instructions in the manual8.tex file:
    * The version of manual8.tex that is checked in for a release, is the version that was used to create the manual.
    * latex manual8.tex  (many times, eliminating errors as you go).
    * run makeindex
    * edit manual8.ind to fix special chars, such as the prefs (see manual8.tex 3c.).  A copy of a working index file is in the repository, called manual8.ind.save.
    * run latex again
    * dvips manual8
    * edit TOC (8.6.3 version needed a pagebreak before section 3)
    * latex and dvips again
    * ps2pdf the file
  * Under Windows, recommend using MikTex to process the laTex files and generate PDF.  First see the instructions in the manual8.tex file, then follow these steps:
    * texify --pdf manual8.tex, editting .tex files and repeating texify til errors eliminated
    * edit manual8.ind and manual8.toc to fix special chars and pagebreaks etc, as for linux.  Recommend that you save those files to `*.save` in case they are inadvertently overwritten.
    * BEFORE running texify again, edit manual8.tex, and just before "\begin{document}, uncomment the \nofiles directive.  This will force MikTex to use your editted TOC and index, instead of generating new (buggy) ones.
    * texify --pdf manual8.tex a final time.
  * No matter how the PDF is generated, you probably need to use acrobat to remove some leading blank pages and resave the file.  
  * Verify document links from TOC and index pages.
  * Save the new PDF file as Soar8Manual.pdf and copy it to ../  (above ManualSource)
  * Commit the new files with comments to the repository.
