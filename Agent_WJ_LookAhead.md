# Water Jug Look-Ahead Agent #

This agent is a modification of the [Water Jug Simple Agent](Agent_WJ_Simple.md) that demonstrates using a tie impasse to subgoal and evaluate operators.  This is an excellent demonstration of look-ahead search and how the selection default rules work.

Unlike the [Water Jug Tie Agent](Agent_WJ_Tie.md), the look-ahead agent has no knowledge that prefers certain moves over others, so it does exhaustive search which takes far more decision cycles.
