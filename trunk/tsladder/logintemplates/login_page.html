<p>login_tools is a module for handling user logins and authentication. It is designed to work with Python CGIs, and can be added to any web application with as little as two lines of code. It provides a framework for signing up new users, administrator login as well as a user 'edit account' screen. It also provides a mechanism for storing/accessing additional user preferences.</p>

<p>login_tools uses HTML templates for the various screens, meaning it can fit into any look and feel of website/application. By storing templates and the config file in different directories, a single install can handle logins for many applications. Applications can share a userbase or have separate ones. Various aspects are configurable - like whether or not new users can sign up.</p>
