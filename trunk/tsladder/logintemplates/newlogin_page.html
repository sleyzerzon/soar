<!-- **message** -->
    <p>Please enter your details below. Once you have successfully completed the form an email will be sent to you asking you to verify the account. This is done by using the link sent in the email. When you have done this you will be able to use  your account to log in. I haven't written out a privacy policy, but I promise never to give your email address to anyone else. The link you are sent will be valid for thirty days.</p>
    
    <p>Your password must be at least five characters long. The login name must be unique (we'll soon tell you if it isn't) - but your 'Real Name' can be whatever you want. This is the name we'll welcome you with. You will be able to change your 'Real Name' later, but you're stuck with whatever you choose as your login name.</p>
