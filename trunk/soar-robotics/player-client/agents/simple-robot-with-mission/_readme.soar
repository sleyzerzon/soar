# things I don't like about the code

# I have to put structures on the top-state for the GDS, which is fine, 
#  but then code associated with those structures has to go in a file
#  associated with the top-state (or else Visual Soar's datamap complains).
#  This forces code that belongs together to be split across different locations,
#  which can make it hard to follow.
# Note: this is really an issue with Visual Soar, not Soar
# Example: elaborations/give-up-on-move-to has rules that are only relevant to
#  execute-mission/go-to-location/give-up-on-move-to
# Example: elaborations/process-unfriendly-entity has rules that are only relevant to
#  execute-mission/scout/process-unfriendly-entity
# Unworkable solution: It might seem that a good approach is to create a link to the 
#  top-state structure in the subgoal, and then elaborate it there. The problem with
#  this approach is that it generates results which will almost certainly be o-supported
#  instead of i-supported (which is what we want). The only way to avoid this is to
#  elaborate the structure onto every substate (thus avoiding testing anything to do
#  with operators, like the state name), but then this creates clutter for those
#  other states.  It's also delicate in the sense that it can easily be broken if someone
#  modifies it without understanding what's going on.

# Similar to the above, messages are processed on the top-state, even if they
# are relevant to what's going on in a substate.
# Example: agent is "scouting" (execute-mission/scout) and gets a message about
# an entity. The scout subgoal already has rules for processing an entity that
# could be generalized to handle entities in messages as opposed to those in input,
# but separate rules are needed for processing the message instead
