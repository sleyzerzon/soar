;;;; This file contains rules, facts and persistants for a specific game 
;;;; instance of BUILD. The file build.core.kif contains the core description
;;;; for the BUILD domain. Appending this file to build.core.kif will produce
;;;; a complete, playable game description.
;;;;
;;;; Goal:
;;;;   Construct a tower with four levels. Each level is composed of a single
;;;;   concrete block whose size decreases as the level in the tower increases.
;;;;   The two bottom blocks must be reinforced.
;;;;
;;;; Solution Sequence (several are possible):
;;;;   (place-adjacent c3 c4 top)         ; clear c2 
;;;;   (place-adjacent c1 c2 top)         ; put c2 on c1
;;;;   (rotate c2)                        ; rotate into place
;;;;   (reinforce c1 rebar)
;;;;   (reinforce c2 rebar)
;;;;   (add-to-compound id1 c4)           ; compound c3 and c4 into id1
;;;;   (add-to-compound id1 c3)
;;;;   (place-adjacent c2 id1 top)
;;;;   (add-to-compound id1 c2)
;;;;   (add-to-compound id1 c1)           ; tower complete
;;;; Goal completed as shown in file build.composing.pdf in 10 steps
