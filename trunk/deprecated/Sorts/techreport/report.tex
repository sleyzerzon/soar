\section{Overview}

The goal of this project is to interface Soar to a real-time strategy
(RTS) game. RTS games, such as StarCraft, WarCraft, and Command and
Conquer, are multi-player strategy games where a player needs to handle
many different tasks- planning base layouts, managing economies,
organizing attacks, responding to enemy attacks, and even diplomacy.
This is all occuring in real time (as the name implies), presenting an
extremely rich, challenging environment for an AI system. Making this
environment accessible to Soar provides many opportunities for both
utilizing existing capabilities and the development of new capabilities.

\subsection{ORTS Overview}

The Open Real Time Strategy software is a highly configurable game
engine used to play real time strategy (RTS) games \cite{ORTS}. The main
purpose for ORTS is to serve as an open source, open interface RTS game
engine for RTS AI tournaments. ORTS is undergoing active development as
of July 2006 at the University of Alberta under the direction of Michael
Buro.

There are several reasons why ORTS is especially suitable for use in
AI tournaments. It has a (relatively) straightforward C++ API, making
interfacing with your favorite AI system easy. All the specific game
mechanics, ranging from types of units, actions, and physics, are
specified via C++ style scripts called blueprints. This means that ORTS
can be easily configured to simulate a wide range of environments,
from arbitrarily simple ones like Wumpus World to complex ones like
Starcraft. Finally, ORTS has a client/server architecture in which
the server maintains the state of the world and only report to the
clients information they are supposed to have for a fair game. This
is in contrast to most commercial RTS games, in which each client
maintains the entire world state and prevents the player from accessing
forbidden information such as other players' locations only by hiding
them from the GUI. The result is that ORTS is impervious to "memory
hack" cheats that are widespread in commercial RTS games. This feature
is particularly important if tournaments are to be run across the
Internet.

\subsection{SORTS Overview}

SORTS is our middleware system that allows Soar to act as a client to
the ORTS game server, so that ORTS game playing agents can be written
in and executed on Soar. SORTS is much more than an interface bridge,
in that it provides fairly complex perception and action systems to the
Soar agent.

The low-level interface to ORTS is essentially a list of objects in the
world, each of which has a set of attributes (like x,y position, health,
owner, and size and shape information), and each of which can take any
of several low-level commands (such as "move", "shoot", or "build"). The
goal of our system is to build on this interface to give the Soar agent
a similar interface to a human playing the game. Some of this entails
adding fairly complex action controllers in the middleware, to replace
what a GUI would provide a human. A person playing a commercial RTS
such as StarCraft can command a unit to move to a location and build a
building in one click, and can send large groups to attack the enemy
semi-autonomously. Low-level behaviors like pathfinding and attack
micromanagement should not be things the Soar agent is concerned with-
the Soar agent should make decisions on the level of when and where to
build and when and where to attack, not how to avoid an obstacle in a
units path.

Similarly, the agent's perceptions need not be on a very low level.
Humans are rarely concerned with the exact x,y positions of the hundreds
of units in their control, and neither should a Soar agent playing the
same game. The SORTS perception system strives to give the Soar agent
the same kind of information a human would recieve from the GUI.

As can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:SORTSOverview}, SORTS is composed of
several modules. The most important of these are the SoarInterface and
the OrtsInterface. The SoarInterface module handles all communication
between Soar and the middleware. It does this by keeping mappings
between structures on the Soar input-link and the middleware-internal
representation of the game state, and updating the input-link whenever
the internal representation is changed. SoarInterface also keeps track
of commands put on the Soar output-link and buffers them into internal
action queues.

On the other hand, the OrtsInterface is the bridge between the
middleware and the ORTS server. It is responsible for updating the
middleware-internal game state based on the messages it receives from
the ORTS server. Unlike SoarInterface, OrtsInterface does not handle
translating internal action representations into actions recognizable by
ORTS. That is handled directly by the behavior FSMs (see
section~\ref{sec:behaviors}).
