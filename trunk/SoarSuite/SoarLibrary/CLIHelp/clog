                                  Description

   The clog command allows users to save all user-interface input and output
   to a file. When Soar is logging to a file, everything typed by the user
   and everything printed by Soar is written to the file (in addition to the
   screen).

   Invoke clog with no arguments (or with -q) to query the current logging
   status. Pass a filename to start logging to that file (relative to the
   command line interface's home directory (see the home command)). Use the
   close option to stop logging.

                                    Examples

   To initiate logging and place the record in foo.log:

 clog foo.log

   To append log data to an existing foo.log file:

 clog -A foo.log

   To terminate logging and close the open log file:

 clog -c

                                  Known Issues

   Does not log everything when structured output is selected.
