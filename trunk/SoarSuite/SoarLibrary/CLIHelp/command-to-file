                                  Description

   This command logs a single command. It is almost equivalent to opening a
   log using clog, running the command, then closing the log, the only
   difference is that input isn't recorded.

   Running this command while a log is open is an error. There is currently
   not support for multiple logs in the command line interface, and this
   would be an instance of multiple logs.

   This command echos output both to the screen and to a file, just like
   clog.
