                                  Description

   The learn command controls the parameters for chunking (Soar's learning
   mechanism). With no arguments, this command prints out the current
   learning environment status. If arguments are provided, they will alter
   the learning environment as described in the options and arguments table.
   The watch command can be used to provide various levels of detail when
   productions are learned. Learning is disabled by default.

   With the --on flag, chunking is on all the time. With the --except flag,
   chunking is on, but Soar will not create chunks for states that have had
   RHS dont-learn actions executed in them. With the --only flag, chunking is
   off, but Soar will create chunks for only those states that have had RHS
   force-learn actions executed in them. With the --off flag, chunking is off
   all the time.

   The --only flag and its companion force-learn RHS action allow Soar
   developers to turn learning on in a particular problem space, so that they
   can focus on debugging the learning problems in that particular problem
   space without having to address the problems elsewhere in their programs
   at the same time. Similarly, the --except flag and its companion
   dont-learn RHS action allow developers to temporarily turn learning off
   for debugging purposes. These facilities are provided as debugging tools,
   and do not correspond to any theory of learning in Soar.

   The --all-levels and --bottom-up flags are orthogonal to the --on,
   --except, --only, and --off flags, and so, may be used in combination with
   them. With bottom-up learning, chunks are learned only in states in which
   no subgoal has yet generated a chunk. In this mode, chunks are learned
   only for the "bottom" of the subgoal hierarchy and not the intermediate
   levels. With experience, the subgoals at the bottom will be replaced by
   the chunks, allowing higher level subgoals to be chunked.

   Learning can be turned on or off at any point during a run.

                                    Examples

   To enable learning only at the lowest subgoal level:

 learn -e b

   To see all the force-learn and dont-learn states registered by RHS actions

 learn -l
