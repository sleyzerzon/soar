O-support is calculated based on the structure of working memory that is tested and modified. Testing an operator or operator acceptable preference results in state or operator augmentations being o-supported. The support computation is very complex (see soar manual). </td></tr><tr><td> 1 </td><td> Not available through gSKI. </td></tr><tr><td> 2 </td><td> Mode 2 is the same as mode 0 except that all support is calculated the production structure, not from working memory structure. Augmentations of operators are still o-supported. </td></tr><tr><td> 3 </td><td> Mode 3 is the same as mode 2 except that operator elaborations (adding attributes to operators) now get i-support even though you have to test the operator to elaborate an operator. </td></tr><tr><td> 4 </td><td> Mode 4 is the default. </td></tr></table><a name="Description"></a><h1> Description </h1><p>The <b>o-support-mode</b> command is used to control the way that o-support is determined for preferences. Only o-support modes 3 &amp; 4 can be considered current to Soar8, and o-support mode 4 should be considered an improved version of mode 3. The default o-support mode is mode 4. <p>In o-support modes 3 &amp; 4, support is given production by production; that is, all preferences generated by the RHS of a single instantiated production will have the same support. The difference between the two modes is in how they handle productions with both operator and non-operator augmentations on the RHS. For more information on o-support calculations, see the relevant appendix in the Soar manual. <p>Running o-support-mode with no arguments prints out the current o-support-mode. <div id="catlinks"><p class="catlinks"><a href="/soarwiki?title=Special:Categories&amp;article=O-support-mode" title="Special:Categories">Categories</a>: <a href="/soarwiki/Category:Command_Line_Interface" title="Category:Command Line Interface">Command Line Interface</a></div><div class="visualClear"></div></div></div></div><div class="visualClear"></div></div></body></html>
