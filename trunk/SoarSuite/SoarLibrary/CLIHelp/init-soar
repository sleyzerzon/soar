                                  Description

   The init-soar command initializes Soar. It removes all elements from
   working memory, wiping out the goal stack, and resets all runtime
   statistics. The firing counts for all productions are reset to zero. The
   init-soar command allows a Soar program that has been halted to be reset
   and start its execution from the beginning.

   init-soar does not remove any productions from production memory; to do
   this, use the excise command. Note however, that all justifications will
   be removed because they will no longer be supported.
