                                      Name

   set-stop-phase - Controls the phase where agents stop when running by
   decision.

                                    Synopsis

 set-stop-phase -[ABadiop]

                                    Options

   Options -A and -B are optional and mutually exclusive. If not specified,
   the default is -B.

   Only one of -a, -d, -i, -o, -p must be selected.

   With no options, reports the current stop phase.

                                  Description

   When running by decision cycle it can be helpful to have agents stop at a
   particular point in its execution cycle. This command allows the user to
   control which phase Soar stops in. The precise definition is that running
   for <n> decisions and stopping before phase <ph> means to run until the
   decision cycle counter has increased by <n> and then stop when the next
   phase is <ph>. The phase sequence (as of this writing) is: input,
   proposal, decision, apply, output. Stopping after one phase is exactly
   equivalent to stopping before the next phase.

   On initialization Soar defaults to stopping before the input phase (or
   after the output phase, however you like to think of it).

   Setting the stop phase applies to all agents.

                                    Examples

 set-stop-phase -Bi                 // stop before input phase
 set-stop-phase -Ad                 // stop after decision phase (before apply phase)
 set-stop-phase -d                  // stop before decision phase
 set-stop-phase --after --output    // stop after output phase
 set-stop-phase                     // reports the current stop phase
