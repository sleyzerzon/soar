TclSoarLib
Author: Mazin Assanie

=====================

- Seamlessly turns Soar prompt into a Tcl prompt with a single command.
  -	Uses a combination of C++ and Tcl code.
  -	Processes commands in embedded Tcl interpreters, which calls Soar commands 
    as needed.
  -	Productions can make Tcl calls by writing “(exec tcl  | <Tcl code> |)” 
    clauses
  on the RHS of rules.  Soar symbols and variables can be include in RHS item.
- Very simple installation process.  
  - The user must simply have ActiveTcl 8.6 installed and the TclSoarlib files 
    in the same directory as the latest Soar dll.
- Provides Tcl capabilities to both local and remote clients, including the 
  java-based C-Soar debugger.
-	Processes Tcl commands from both the Soar command line and any files sourced.
- Each agent has its own Tcl interpreter.
-	Tested on OSX Maverick, Windows 7, and Ubuntu 12.04.

=====
Usage
=====

To enable:

From any soar prompt enter the command:

% cli Tcl on

To disable:

% cli Tcl off

===================
Binary Installation
===================

1.	Install ActiveTcl 8.6+ (http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads)
    - We recommend that you use the default install location.

2.	Download the SoarSuite binary for your platform from the Soar wiki
    - https://code.google.com/p/soar/wiki/Downloads
    - TclSoarLib is automatically included in the SoarSuite download.

=========================
Building from Source Code
=========================

1.	Make sure ActiveTcl 8.6 is installed.  
    - http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads
    - We recommend that you use the default install location.

2.	Download the SoarSuite source code from the wiki or check out the
    SVN repository
    - https://code.google.com/p/soar/wiki/Downloads
    - Follow the standard build instructions for your platform until you get to 
      the build step

3.	When you get to the compilation step, specify either the “all” or the 
    “tclsoarlib” build target.  

    For example, on Windows:

    % build all

    or 

    % build tclsoarlib

==========
Known Bugs
==========

1.  Turning off tcl mode causes a crash on some systems.  That option is
    currently disabled as a result.

=======
Caveats
=======

1.	You cannot turn tcl on in a sourced file that has tcl code in it

Soar cannot deal with such files because it does not load the tcl interpreter 
until the source command completes.  Future versions can remedy this issue.  A 
more immediate solution would be to have TclSoarLib automatically loaded on 
Soar launch, if it exists.

2.	Currently uses two aliasing mechanism

Because the module wraps known soar commands, aliases are problematic.  For now 
TclSoarLib follows previous implementations and switches to its own alias 
system.  When Tcl mode is turned on, aliases defined in alias.Tcl are used.  
Soar aliases previously defined will no longer be recognized until Tcl mode 
is turned off.  Future versions can remedy this issue.

3.	Only one RHS Tcl call will produce output. 
 
Soar rhs commands “write” (and  even something like “cmd echo”) will always 
work.  But only the last Tcl function called can produce output, for example a 
“puts” command or a custom Tcl proc that produces output as a side effect.  
That said,  all rhs Tcl calls do get executed, so they will do what they are 
supposed to do, including perhaps writing output to a file.  The problem is 
that the print output just doesn’t get redirected to the right place, despite 
being produced.

As a workaround, a user can make sure  both that there is only one Tcl call 
which needs to produce output and that it comes after any other Tcl RHS 
actions. 

Future versions can remedy this issue, but it may require a different 
implementation for rhs output.

4.	Does not support Tk code

Tk is a widget toolkit that many Tcl programs use to provide a GUI, for 
example the old Soar TSI debugger.  Future versions can remedy this issue.

5.	Tcl code that tries to do low-level Soar functions may or may not work.

Creating and deleting a kernel will certainly not work.  But other things like 
creating an agent, other sml calls, other swig calls may work fine.  This 
caveat is inherent to the design of Tcl as a plug-in without a main event loop.

6.	Tcl code that requires a Tcl event loop may or may not work

One example is the Tcl “after” command.  Future versions can remedy this issue.
