Soar 9.0.0 Release Notes
========================

This release of Soar begins the 9.x series of releases during which we 
expect to introduce several new mechanisms. 9.0.0 includes reinforcement
learning code (Soar-RL), which was first released alongside the 8.6.4
beta. 9.0.0 is also the first release to include the SML interface 
without gSKI.

Soar-RL is the architectural integration of reinforcement learning (RL) with
Soar.  The RL mechanism will automatically tune the values of
numeric-indifferent preference rules based on reward generated while a Soar
agent executes.  These values represent the expected discounted sum of
future rewards the agent will receive if it selects that operator for states
matched by the condition of the rule.  See the RL manual and tutorial in
Documentation.

To see Soar-RL in action right away, try the Water Jug RL demo (it can be
loaded from the Demos->Water Jug menu in the Java Debugger). To see the effects
of RL, run it to completion, then init-soar and run it again. Repeat 4-5 times
to see it reach optimal behavior. (Note: the agent may occasionally perform
non-optimal behavior even after it has converged because of its exploration 
policy. See the RL manual and tutorial for details).

Soar-9.0.0 includes all source code, many demo programs, and a 
number of applications that serve as examples of how to interface 
Soar to an external Environment.  There is support for integrating 
Soar with C++, Java, Tcl, Python and C# applications.  Many Tools
that aid in development of Soar programs are also included.

These Release Notes describe the primary changes in this 
latest release.  More detailed information can be obtained at

This release was generated for Windows, Linux, and OSX systems.  
Windows XP and Vista are supported.

Installation Requirements
=========================

* On Windows, the 19MB download file expands to ~45MB when extracted.  
  Linux and OSX disk requirements are similar.

* Java 1.5.0 or newer is required to use the Java applications,
  including the debugger (Java must be available in the path). Get it 
  at http://java.sun.com/. Most operating systems probably already have 
  Java installed. NOTE: Java 1.4.2 is no longer supported.

* If you want to run Tcl applications on Linux, Tcl 8.4.x or later is
  required (note that the tutorial applications are now available in
  Java).  Also note that we do not currently support threaded builds
  of Tcl (e.g. ActiveTcl 8.4.11.2 or later).

* The included Python libraries support Python 2.4.  Python 2.5 support
  requires a rebuild of the ClientSMLPython project.

Build Requirements
==================
Binaries are released for Windows/Linux/OS X, so building is not required.
For those on other platforms or developers:
* On all platforms, SWIG 1.3.31 or later is required to build with 
  cross-language support (e.g. to use the Java debugger).
* On Windows, Visual Studio 2005 SP1 is required.
* On Linux/Unix/OS X, Python, SCons, gcc 3.3 or later required.

Components of Soar 9.0.0
========================
* Pre-built libraries and executables for Windows (SoarLibrary/bin)
* all source code, config files, and OS tools for automated Soar builds
* SoarJavaDebugger 
* VisualSoar
* JavaEaters, JavaTankSoar, TclEaters
* Test and Demo programs
* Documentation

New in 9.0.0
============

* Components and Capabilities added
  -- RL commands and documentation added (see RL manual and tutorial
     in Documentation directory).
  -- indifferent-selection command updated to support options primarily
     intended for (but not limited to) RL.
  -- select and predict commands added to control operator selection
     (essentially replaces defunct indifferent-selection --ask functionality).
  -- New "gp" command added. Generates rules based on simple patterns
     (intended for use with RL).
  -- Updated selection space to remove local negations (prevents some
     chunking problems), added iterative deepening support.
  -- Added options to learn command to turn chunking through local negations
     on or off (on by default for backwards compatibility). If off, a message
	 will be generated if "watch --learning print" is enabled that says a chunk was not created
	 because of local negations, and what those negations were.
  -- In a tie impasse, an item-count WME containing the number of tied operators is now
     architecturally generated.
  -- Depth at which productions are firing is reported at watch 5.
  -- Multiple rules can be loaded via the Java debugger's Edit Production
     widget, scratch pad, and by pasting into the trace window. This is the
	 result of an underlying change to SML in which arguments to
	 ExecuteCommandLine are passed through logic associated with the source
	 command, and thus multiple commands can be given at once.
  -- Command boxes in the Java debugger have been enhanced so that history
     browsing with the up/down arrows works on all platforms.
  -- New "single compilation unit" build configurations (greatly speeds build time).
  -- Unit test suite added.
  -- Other minor enhancements.

* Bug fixes
  -- Output link supports circular structures.
  -- Duplicate productions no longer cause sourcing to stop.
  -- Various memory leaks fixed.
  -- Several other minor fixes.

* Other updates
  -- Removed gSKI (10-30% speed increase in simple benchmarking).
  -- The Soar Java Debugger now uses its default layout the first time
     it is run with a new version of Soar. Old layouts are preserved
     and can be loaded if desired (which makes them the default).


Known issues:
=============

* ^status complete appears on the ^output-link immediately instead 
  of during the next input phase.
* The Soar 7 mode implementation currently relies on an ugly hack. If
  you experience problems in this mode, please let us know.
* Many other minor issues (see bugzilla for details).
