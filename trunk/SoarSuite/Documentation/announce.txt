Soar 8.6.4 Release Notes
========================

Soar-8.6.4 includes all source code, many demo programs, and a 
number of applications that serve as examples of how to interface 
Soar to an external Environment.  There is support for integrating 
Soar with C++, Java, Tcl, Python and C# applications.  Many Tools
that aid in development of Soar programs are also included.

These Release Notes describe the primary changes in this 
latest release.  More detailed information can be obtained at 
http://winter.eecs.umich.edu/soarwiki

This release was generated for Windows and Linux systems.  Windows Vista
is also supported.  OS X support is pending a volunteer willing to work 
on it.

Soar 8.6.4 can be downloaded from the Soar homepage at:

Installation Requirements
=========================

* On Windows, the 19MB download file expands to ~46MB when installed.  
  Linux disk requirements are similar.

* Java 1.5.0 or newer is required to use the Java applications,
  including the debugger.  (java must be available in the path). Get it 
  at http://java.sun.com/. Most operating systems probably already have 
  Java installed. NOTE: Java 1.4.2 is no longer supported.

* If you want to run Tcl applications on Linux, Tcl 8.4.x or later is
  required (note that the tutorial applications are now available in
  Java).  Also note that we do not currently support threaded builds
  of Tcl (e.g. ActiveTcl 8.4.11.2 or later).

* The included Python libraries support Python 2.4.  Python 2.5 support
  requires a rebuild of the ClientSMLPython project.

Known issues:
=============

* Remote connections on Linux can be slow.
* ^status complete appears on the ^output-link immediately instead 
  of during the next input phase.
* The Soar 7 mode implementation currently relies on an ugly hack. If
  you experience problems in this mode, please let us know.
* In TankSoar, the obscure-bot sometimes generates a scary-looking
  kernel error message.  It appears to be safe to ignore.
* Many other minor issues (see bugzilla for details).
