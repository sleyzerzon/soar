and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

2. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented, either by

   PCRE in software that you distribute to others, commercially or
   otherwise, you must put a sentence like this

     Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
     which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
     by the University of Cambridge, England.

   somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant
   files or online help data or similar. A reference to the ftp site for
   the source, that is, to

     ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/

   should also be given in the documentation. However, this condition is not
   intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
   it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
   A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE
   independently).

3. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
   misrepresented as being the original software.

4. If PCRE is embedded in any software that is released under the GNU
   General Purpose Licence (GPL), or Lesser General Purpose Licence (LGPL),
   then the terms of that licence shall supersede any condition above with
   which it is incompatible.

The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc" directory, is distributed
under the same terms as the software itself.
