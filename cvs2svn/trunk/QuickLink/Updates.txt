-Everything now loads with the keyword "load" ("loadp" is invalid).
-The command to continue a process is "continue" or "cont".
-There is no longer a need to use "endoffile" or "endofprocess".
-"endofstep" is optional at the end of a file.
-An error message is now printed if "continue" is called when a process is not running.
-"endp" works correctly - ends a running process
-"endofstep" has now become "pause"
