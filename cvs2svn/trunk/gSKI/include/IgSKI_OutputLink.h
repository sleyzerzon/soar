    * registration and invocation of the OutputProcessor objects. Registration
    * is done through the AddOutputProcessor() method, which essentially 
    * associates a pattern on the OutputLink with an OutputProcessor. 
    * All WMObjects that match the specified pattern are then passed to the
    * specified OutputProcessor which handles converting the wme's to 
    * function/method calls and data for modifying the simulation environment.
    * If a WMObject matches multiple patterns it will be passed to multiple
    * OutputProcessors for processing. The OutputProcessors can be set to 
    * automatically process output during the Agent's output cycle or they
    * can be manually invoked using the SetAutomaticUpdate() or 
    * UpdateProcessors() methods.
