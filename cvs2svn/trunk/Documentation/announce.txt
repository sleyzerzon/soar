Requirements
============

* Java 1.4.2 or later required to use the Java debugger (javaw.exe should be available in the path).

New in this release
===================

** Tcl Eaters is now included.
** Java Missionaries and Cannibals is now included.
** Updated manual.
** Updated tutorials for new debugger.
** Added partial command matching for command line.
** Improved and extended kernel XML generation resulting in performance boost for those applications which use it (i.e. the Java debugger)
** Introduced new event-driven simulation support, removing the need for "start-system" command (see documentation for details).
** Several other bugfixes.

* Java Debugger:
** Added support for filters, making the trace easier to read than ever before.
** Replaced tree trace window in debugger with faster version.
** Added lots of aliases that existed in older versions of Soar.
** Fixed bug in Java debugger resulting in massive performance boost.

Known issues:
=============

* Log command only works properly from Java debugger if in text mode (as opposed to tree mode).
* Tanksoar is not yet available.
* Soar seems to "stutter" under Mac OS 10.4 (but it does work properly).
* On Linux sometimes the trace output can fall behind actual execution, making the debugger appear unresponsive (it's really just trying to catch up).
* Some rare warning messages may not appear fully in the Java debugger's tree view (but they appear fine in the text view).  If you find specific cases of this, please let us know.
