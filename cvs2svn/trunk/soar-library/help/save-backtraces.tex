\subsubsection*{Description}
 The save-backtraces variable is a toggle that controls whether or not backtracing information (from chunks and justifications) is saved. 
 When save-backtraces is set to off, backtracing information is not saved and explanations of the chunks and justifications that are formed can not be retrieved. When save-backtraces is set to on, backtracing information can be retrieved by using the explain-backtraces command. Saving backtracing information may slow down the execution of your Soar program, but it can be a very useful tool in understanding how chunks are formed.
