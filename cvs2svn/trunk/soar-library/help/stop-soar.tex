\subsubsection*{Description}
 The \textbf{stop-soar}
 command stops any running Soar agents. It sets a flag in the Soar kernel so that Soar will stop running at a ``safe'' point and return control to the user. This command is usually not issued at the command line prompt - a more common use of this command would be, for instance, as a side-effect of pressing a button on a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
\subsubsection*{Default Aliases}

\hyperref[run]{run} \subsubsection*{Warnings}
 If the graphical interface doesn't periodically do an ``update'' of flush the pending I/O, then it may not be possible to interrupt a Soar agent from the command line.
