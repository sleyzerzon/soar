\subsubsection*{Description}
, and Soar will proceed to the next phase. A warning message is printed to notify the user that the limit has been reached. 
 This limit is included in Soar to prevent getting stuck in an infinite loop during the chunking process. This could conceivably happen because newly-built chunks may match immediately and are fired immediately when this happens; this can in turn lead to additional chunks being formed, etc. If you see this warning, something is seriously wrong; Soar is unable to guarantee consistency of its internal structures. You should not continue execution of the Soar program in this situation; stop and determine whether your program needs to build more chunks or whether you've discovered a bug (in your program or in Soar itself).
