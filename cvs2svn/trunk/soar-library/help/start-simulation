                                  Description

   Signals an external simulation that it should start executing, which
   typically causes it to start running Soar agents. It's analogous to
   pressing a "run" or "go" in the simulation itself and allows a simulation
   to be started from any command line prompt. If there is no external
   simulation this command will have no effect.

                                    Examples
