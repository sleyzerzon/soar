                                  Description

   The matches command prints a list of productions that have instantiations
   in the match set, i.e., those productions that will retract or fire in the
   next Propose or Apply phase. It also will preint partial match information
   for a single, named production.

Printing the match set

   When printing the match set (i.e., no production name is specified), the
   default action prints only the names of the productions which are about to
   fire or retract. If there are multiple instantiations of a production, the
   total number of instantiations of that production is printed after the
   production name, unless --timetags|1 or --wmes|2 are specified, in which
   case each instantiation is printed on a separate line.

   When printing the match set, the --assertions and --retractions arguments
   may be specified to restrict the output to print only the assertions or
   retractions.

Printing partial matches for productions

   In addition to printing the current match set, the matches command can be
   used to print information about partial matches for a named production. In
   this case, the conditions of the production are listed, each preceded by
   the number of currently active matches for that condition. If a condition
   is negated, it is preceded by a minus sign -. The pointer >>>> before a
   condition indicates that this is the first condition that failed to match.

   When printing partial matches, the default action is to print only the
   counts of the number of WME's that match, and is a handy tool for
   determining which condition failed to match for a production that you
   thought should have fired. At levels 1 and 2 (or --timetags and --wmes
   arguments) the matches command displays the WME's immediately after the
   first condition that failed to match --- temporarily interrupting the
   printing of the production conditions themselves.

Notes

   When printing partial match information, some of the matches displayed by
   this command may have already fired, depending on when in the execution
   cycle this command is called. To check for the matches that are about to
   fire, use the matches command without a named production.

   In Soar 8, the execution cycle (decision cycle) is input, propose, decide,
   apply output; it no longer stops for user input after the decision phase
   when running by decision cycles (run -d 1). If a user wishes to print the
   match set immediately after the decision phase and before the apply phase,
   then the user must run Soar by phases (run -p 1).

                                    Examples

   This example prints the productions which are about to fire and the wmes
   that match the productions on their left-hand sides:

 matches --assertions --wmes

   This example prints the wme timetags for a single production.

 matches -t my*first*production
