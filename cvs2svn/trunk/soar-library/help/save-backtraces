                                  Description

   The save-backtraces variable is a toggle that controls whether or not
   backtracing information (from chunks and justifications) is saved.

   When save-backtraces is set to off, backtracing information is not saved
   and explanations of the chunks and justifications that are formed can not
   be retrieved. When save-backtraces is set to on, backtracing information
   can be retrieved by using the explain-backtraces command. Saving
   backtracing information may slow down the execution of your Soar program,
   but it can be a very useful tool in understanding how chunks are formed.
