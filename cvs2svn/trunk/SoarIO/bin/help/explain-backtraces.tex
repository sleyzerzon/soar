\section*{ Description }


 This command provides some interpretation of backtraces generated during chunking. If no option is given, then a list of all chunks and justifications is printed. 


 The two most useful variants are: \begin{verbatim}
explain-backtraces prodname 
explain-backtraces name n

\end{verbatim}



 The first variant lists all of the conditions for the named chunk or justification, and the ground which resulted in inclusion in the chunk/justification. A ground is a working memory element (WME) which was tested in the supergoal. Just knowing which WME was tested may be enough to explain why the chunk/justification exists. If not, the conditions can be listed with an integer value. This value can be used in explain-backtraces name n to obtain a list of the productions which fired to obtain this condition in the chunk/justification (and the crucial WMEs tested along the way). Why use an integer value to specify the condition? To save a big parsing job. 


 save\_backtraces mode must be on when a chunk or justification is created or no explanation will be available.
