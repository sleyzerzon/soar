                                  Description

   The production-find command is used to find productions in production
   memory that include conditions or actions that match a given pattern. The
   pattern given specifies one or more condition elements on the left hand
   side of productions (or negated conditions), or one or more actions on the
   right-hand side of productions. Any pattern that can appear in productions
   can be used in this command. In addition, the asterisk symbol, *, can be
   used as a wildcard for an attribute or value. It is important to note that
   the whole pattern, including the parenthesis, must be enclosed in curly
   braces for it to be parsed properly.

   The variable names used in a call to production-find do not have to match
   the variable names used in the productions being retrieved.

   The production-find command can also be restricted to apply to only
   certain types of productions, or to look only at the conditions or only at
   the actions of productions by using the flags.

                                    Examples

   Find productions that test that some object gumby has an attribute alive
   with value t. In addition, limit the rules to only those that test an
   operator named foo:

 production-find {(<state> ^gumby <gv> ^operator.name foo)(<gv> ^alive t)}

   Note that in the above command, <state> does not have to match the exact
   variable name used in the production.

   Find productions that propose the operator foo:

 production-find -rhs {(<x> ^operator <op> +)(<op> ^name foo)}

   Find chunks that test the attribute ^pokey:

 production-find -chunks {(<x> ^pokey *)}
