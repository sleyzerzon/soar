   [edit]

                                  Description

   This command is likely to be dropped. It was implemented before directory
   structure resolved and now probably not needed and adds to confusion.

   Used to set the directory where the cd command returns to when invoked
   with no arguments.

                                    Examples

   To show how to use the command in context, do this:

 command --option arg

   and possibly explain the results.
