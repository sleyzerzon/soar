\section*{ Description }


 The matches command prints a list of productions that have instantiations in the match set, i.e., those productions that will retract or fire in the next Propose or Apply phase. It also will preint partial match information for a single, named production. 
\section*{ Description from Soar 8.3 }


 This command prints partial match information for a selected production. If issued at the end of the Decision Phase, it also prints the current set of productions that are about to fire or retract in the next APPLY phase. This information is useful for determining what changes to working memory are necessary in order to achieve a match of the left-hand sides of productions. If no production name is given, then it is assumed that the user desires information about the entire match set, including both assertions and retractions. In Soar 8, the Decision Phase occurs in the middle of the Decision Cycle, followed by the Apply Phase. Therefore, at the end of the Decision Cycle, productions will have already fired and the ``matches'' command will not be very helpful. To examine the match information in immediately after the Decision Phase in Soar 8, users can implement either of the following callbacks: \begin{verbatim}
         monitor -add {matches -wmes} after-decision-phase-cycle

\end{verbatim}
 \begin{verbatim}
         monitor -add {stop-soar -self} after-decision-phase-cycle

\end{verbatim}



 The first example can use any options to the matches command, whatever the user finds most helpful. The second option, which stops Soar at the end of the Decision Phase, offers the most flexibility for debugging. It is recommended that users issue this callback for all agents, so they don't get out of synch when running. Once the productions have been debugged, the monitors can be deleted.

\section*{ Examples }


 This example prints the productions which are about to fire and the wmes that match the productions on their left-hand sides: \begin{verbatim}
matches --assertions --wmes

\end{verbatim}



 This example prints the wme timetags for a single production. \begin{verbatim}
matches -t my*first*production</code.

\end{verbatim}
