                                  Description

   This command declares the given symbol to be an attribute which can take
   on multiple values. The optional n is an integer (>1) indicating an upper
   limit on the number of expected values that will appear for an attribute.
   If n is not specified, the value 10 is used for each declared
   multi-attribute. More informed values will tend to result in greater
   efficiency. This command is used only to provide hints to the production
   condition reorderer so it can produce better condition orderings. Better
   orderings enable the rete network to run faster. This command has no
   effect on the actual contents of working memory and most users needn't use
   this at all.

 Note that multi-attributes declarations must be made before productions
 are loaded into soar or this command will have no effect.
