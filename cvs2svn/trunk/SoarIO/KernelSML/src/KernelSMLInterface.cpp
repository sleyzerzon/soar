//
// This file provides a C level interface into the KernelSML library and
// implements "EmbeddedSMLInterface.h" (so there is no KernelSMLInteface.h file).
//
// KernelSML receives commands in SML (a dialect of XML), sends them to the Soar kernel
// and then returns the results in SML.
//
// The SML can be passed directly as an object into this library (if the client and kernel happen
// to be in the same process) or the SML can be sent as a regular XML stream.
