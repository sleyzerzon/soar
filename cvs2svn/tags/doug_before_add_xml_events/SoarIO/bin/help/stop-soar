                                  Description

   This command is usually not issued at the command line prompt. A more
   common use of this command is as a side-effect of pressing a button on a
   Graphical User Interface (GUI), or as a monitor to be executed at a
   specific Soar Event. For example, a user may wish to examine an agent's
   "matches" after the Soar Decision Phase. In order to do this in Soar 8,
   the user must register a monitor, or callback, to issue the "stop-soar
   -self" command for the event, after-decision-phase-cycle.

                                    Examples

   This example shows how to stop Soar8 after this decision phase using
   stop-soar -self in a monitor to stop after the decision phase so that
   memory can be examined.

 monitor -add {stop-soar --self "after decision phase"} after-decision-phase-cycle

                                    Warnings

   If the graphical interface doesn't periodically do an "update" of flush
   the pending I/O, then it may not be possible to interrupt a Soar agent
   from the command line.
