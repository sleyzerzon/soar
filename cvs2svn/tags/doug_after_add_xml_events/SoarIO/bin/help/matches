                                  Description

   The matches command prints a list of productions that have instantiations
   in the match set, i.e., those productions that will retract or fire in the
   next Propose or Apply phase. It also will preint partial match information
   for a single, named production.

   [edit]

                           Description from Soar 8.3

   This command prints partial match information for a selected production.
   If issued at the end of the Decision Phase, it also prints the current set
   of productions that are about to fire or retract in the next APPLY phase.
   This information is useful for determining what changes to working memory
   are necessary in order to achieve a match of the left-hand sides of
   productions. If no production name is given, then it is assumed that the
   user desires information about the entire match set, including both
   assertions and retractions. In Soar 8, the Decision Phase occurs in the
   middle of the Decision Cycle, followed by the Apply Phase. Therefore, at
   the end of the Decision Cycle, productions will have already fired and the
   "matches" command will not be very helpful. To examine the match
   information in immediately after the Decision Phase in Soar 8, users can
   implement either of the following callbacks:

          monitor -add {matches -wmes} after-decision-phase-cycle

          monitor -add {stop-soar -self} after-decision-phase-cycle

   The first example can use any options to the matches command, whatever the
   user finds most helpful. The second option, which stops Soar at the end of
   the Decision Phase, offers the most flexibility for debugging. It is
   recommended that users issue this callback for all agents, so they don't
   get out of synch when running. Once the productions have been debugged,
   the monitors can be deleted.

                                    Examples

   This example prints the productions which are about to fire and the wmes
   that match the productions on their left-hand sides:

 matches --assertions --wmes

   This example prints the wme timetags for a single production.

 matches -t my*first*production</code.
