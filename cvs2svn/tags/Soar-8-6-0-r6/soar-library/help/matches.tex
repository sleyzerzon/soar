 -0, -n, --names, -c, --count  & For the match set, print only the names of the productions that are about to fire or retract (the default). If printing partial matches for a production, just list the partial match counts.  \\

 -2, -w, --wmes  & Also print the full wmes, not just the timetags, at the first failing condition.  \\

\subsubsection*{Description}
 The matches command prints a list of productions that have instantiations in the match set, i.e., those productions that will retract or fire in the next Propose or Apply phase. It also will preint partial match information for a single, named production. 
\subsection*{Printing the match set}
 When printing the match set (i.e., no production name is specified), the default action prints only the names of the productions which are about to fire or retract. If there are multiple instantiations of a production, the total number of instantiations of that production is printed after the production name, unless \textbf{--timetags|1}
 or \textbf{--wmes|2}
 are specified, in which case each instantiation is printed on a separate line. 
 When printing the match set, the \textbf{--assertions}
 and \textbf{--retractions}
 arguments may be specified to restrict the output to print only the assertions or retractions. 
\subsection*{Printing partial matches for productions}
. The pointer \textbf{$>$$>$$>$$>$}
 before a condition indicates that this is the first condition that failed to match. 
 When printing partial matches, the default action is to print only the counts of the number of WME's that match, and is a handy tool for determining which condition failed to match for a production that you thought should have fired. At levels \textbf{1}
 and \textbf{2}
 (or \textbf{--timetags}
 and \textbf{--wmes}
\subsection*{Notes}
 In Soar 8, the execution cycle (decision cycle) is input, propose, decide, apply output; it no longer stops for user input after the decision phase when running by decision cycles (\textbf{run -d 1}
). If a user wishes to print the match set immediately after the decision phase and before the apply phase, then the user must run Soar by \emph{phases}
 (\textbf{run -p 1}
). 
\subsubsection*{Examples}
 (fix this) - output? This example prints the productions which are about to fire and the wmes that match the productions on their left-hand sides: \begin{verbatim}
matches --assertions --wmes
\end{verbatim}
 This example prints the wme timetags for a single production. \begin{verbatim}
matches -t my*first*production</code.
\end{verbatim}
