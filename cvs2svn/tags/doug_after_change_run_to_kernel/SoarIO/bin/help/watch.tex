\subsection*{ Watch Levels }


 Use of the --level (-l) flag is optional but recommended. 

\begin{tabular}{|p{1in}|p{5in}|}
\hline 
 0  & watch nothing; equivalent to \^a€“N  \\
 \hline 
 1  & watch decisions; equivalent to -d  \\
 \hline 
 2  & watch phases and decisions; equivalent to -dp  \\
 \hline 
 3  & watch productions, phases, and decisions; equivalent to -dpP  \\
 \hline 
 4  & watch wmes, productions, phases, and decisions; equivalent to -dpPw  \\
 \hline 
 5  & watch preferences, wmes, productions, phases, and decisions; equivalent to -dpPwr  \\
 \hline 

\end{tabular}




 \\ 
 It is important to note that watch level 0 turns off ALL watch options, including backtracing, indifferent selection and learning. However, the other watch levels do not change these settings. That is, if any of these settings is changed from its default, it will retain its new setting until it is either explicitly changed again or the watch level is set to 0. 
\subsection*{ Remove }


 The remove argument has a numeric alias; you can use 0 for remove. A mix of formats is acceptable, even in the same command line. 

\begin{tabular}{|p{1in}|p{1in}|p{4in}|}
\hline 
 remove  & 0  & Turn watching off only for the specified option  \\
 \hline 

\end{tabular}


\subsection*{ Learning }


 The learning options have numeric aliases; you can use 0 for noprint, 1 for print, and 2 for fullprint. A mix of formats is acceptable, even in the same command line. 

\begin{tabular}{|p{1in}|p{1in}|p{4in}|}
\hline 
 noprint  & 0  & Print nothing about new chunks or justifications (default)  \\
 \hline 
 print  & 1  & Print the names of new chunks and justifications when created  \\
 \hline 
 fullprint  & 2  & Print entire chunks and justifications when created  \\
 \hline 

\end{tabular}

\section*{ Description }


 The watch command controls run-time tracing of Soar. With no arguments, this command prints out the current watch status. The various levels are used to modify the current watch settings. Each level can be indicated with either a number or a series of flags as follows: \begin{verbatim}
0 or --none
1 or --decisions
2 or --decisions --phases
3 or --decisions --phases --productions
4 or --decisions --phases --productions --wmes
5 or --decisions --phases --productions --wmes --preferences

\end{verbatim}



 The numerical arguments \emph{inclusively}
 turn on all levels up to the number specified. To use numerical arguments to turn off a level, specify a number which is less than the level to be turned off. For instance, to turn off watching of productions, specify ``watch --level 2'' (or 1 or 0). Numerical arguments are provided for shorthand convenience. For more detailed control over the watch settings, the named arguments should be used. 


 For the named arguments, including the named argument turns on only that setting. To turn off a specific setting, follow the named argument with \emph{remove}
 or \emph{0}
. 


 The named argument --productions is shorthand for the four arguments --default, --user, --justifications, and --chunks. 


 The pwatch command is used to watch individual productions specified by name rather than watch a type of productions, such as --user. 
\section*{ Examples }


 The most common uses of watch are by using the numeric arguments which indicate watch levels. To turn off all printing of Soar internals, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed): \begin{verbatim}
watch --level 0
watch -l 0
watch -N

\end{verbatim}



 Although the --level flag is optional, its use is recommended: \begin{verbatim}
watch --level 5 \emph{... OK}

watch 5         \emph{... OK, but try to avoid}


\end{verbatim}



 Be careful of where the level is on the command line, for example, if you want level 2 and preferences: \begin{verbatim}
watch -r -l 2 \emph{... Incorrect: -r flag ignored, level 2 parsed after it and overrides the setting}

watch -r 2    \emph{... Syntax error: 0 or remove expected as optional argument to -r}

watch -r -l 2 \emph{... Incorrect: -r flag ignored, level 2 parsed after it and overrides the setting}

watch 2 -r    \emph{... OK, but try to avoid}

watch -l 2 -r \emph{... OK}


\end{verbatim}



 To turn on printing of decisions, phases and productions, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed): \begin{verbatim}
watch --level 3
watch -l 3
watch --decisions --phases --productions
watch -d -p -P

\end{verbatim}



 Individual options can be changed as well. To turn on printing of decisions and wmes, but not phases and productions, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed): \begin{verbatim}
watch --level 1 --wmes
watch -l 1 -w
watch --decisions --wmes
watch -d --wmes
watch -w --decisions
watch -w -d

\end{verbatim}



 To turn on printing of decisions, productions and wmes, and turns phases off, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed): \begin{verbatim}
watch --level 4 --phases remove
watch -l 4 -p remove
watch -l 4 -p 0
watch -d -P -w -p remove

\end{verbatim}



 To watch the firing and retraction of decisions and \emph{only}
 user productions, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed): \begin{verbatim}
watch -l 1 -u
watch -d -u

\end{verbatim}



 To watch decisions, phases and all productions \emph{except}
 user productions and justifications, and to see full wmes, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed): \begin{verbatim}
watch --decisions --phases --productions --user remove --justifications remove --fullwmes
watch -d -p -P -f -u remove -j 0 
watch -f -l 3 -u 0 -j 0

\end{verbatim}
