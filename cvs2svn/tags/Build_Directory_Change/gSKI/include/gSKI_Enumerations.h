   *  Agent stop points definition.

   *   by this enumeration. One of these enumerated values is passed
   *   to one of the Stop methods when commanding an agent to stop.
   *

   *
   *  @li STOP_ON_CALLBACK_RETURN:  Stop immediately after the next callback return event.
   *        If Stop(gSKI_STOP_ON_CALLBACK_RETURN) is called from within a 
   *        callback, the agent(s) will stop after that callback returns.  
   *        If it is called outside of a callback, the agent(s) will stop after
   *        the next callback returns.
   *  @li STOP_AFTER_ALL_CALLBACKS_RETURN: Stop after the next set of callbacks
   *       is notified.  If the system is in the middle of notifying listeners
   *       of an event, the stop occurs after the last listener is notified
   *       of that event.
   *  @li STOP_AFTER_CURRENT_PHASE: Stop immediately after completing processing
   *       for the current phase. The phase is either an elaboration phase
   *       or a decision phase, whichever the system is executing when the
   *       stop method is called.
   *  @li STOP_NEXT_ELABORATION_PHASE: Stop at the beginning of the next 
   *       elaboration phase.
   *  @li STOP_NEXT_DECISION_PHASE: Stop at the beginning of the next decision
   *       phase.
