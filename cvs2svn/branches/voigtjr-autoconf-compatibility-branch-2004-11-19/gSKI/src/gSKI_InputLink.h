   * and invocation of the InputProducer objects. Registration is done
   * through the AddInputProducer() and AddReplacementPolicy() methods,
   * which essentially associate an InputProducer with a WMObject or a 
   * WmeReplacementPolicy with a Wme. The InputProducers are responsible 
   * for adding and removing WMObjects and Wmes to the input link while the 
   * WmeReplacementPolicies essentially determine if a request for a Wme
   * replacement is performed or not.
