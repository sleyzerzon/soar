    * @brief Interface used to represent the id, attribute and value of a WME.
    *
    * This interface is used essentially as a variant to represent the 
    * identifiers, attributes and values exposed by the IWme interface.
    * The interface contains methods for retrieving both numerical and
    * string representations of the various types stored in the symbol.
    * The current DOUBLE, INT, STRING and ID types can be stored in a
    * symbol (@see egSKI_SYMBOL_TYPE).
    *
    * @note IMPORTANT: gSymbol is a wrapper around the soar symbol.
    *        There are two ways the wrapper could work.  It could
    *        take over ownership of the symbol, or it could share
    *        ownership.  We have implemented the latter.  This means
    *        that if you pass in a Soar Symbol pointer to the constructor
    *        or to SetValue, gSymbol will add a reference to it.  If you
    *        had added a reference, you will need to release it yourself.
    *        The place where this is the biggest issue is when you pass
    *        in a Soar symbol that you create using make_XXXX_symbol or
    *        get_new_io...  The Soar functions for creating new symbols
    *        initialize the reference count to 1.  You will need to release
    *        your reference count after passing the Soar symbol into a 
    *        gSymbol object.  However, if you just grab a raw Symbol* 
    *        from some Soar structure, you do not have to release or add ref
    *        as long as you put it in a gSymbol and manipulate it through
    *        the gSymbol.
    *
    * Pointers to ISymbols can be obtained in the following ways:
    *   @li Using the GetAttribute(), or GetValue methods of IWme
    *   @li From an ISymbolFactory instance
