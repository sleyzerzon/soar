# Getting the Source #

There are two ways to get the source code:
  * Download the the [9.3.4 platform-independent source](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~soar/downloads/SoarSuite/SoarSuite_9.3.4-source.zip).  This will contain the last major release of the entire SoarSuite.
**OR**
  * Pull the latest code directly from the [Soar git repository on github](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar).  Information about using git can be found on github.

> You can now skip to your operating system build notes:

  * [Windows Build Notes](BuildWindows.md)
  * [Linux Build Notes](BuildLinux.md)
  * [Mac OS X Build Notes](BuildMac.md)
