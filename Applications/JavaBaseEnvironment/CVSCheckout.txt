Eaters and Tanksoar (formerly JavaEnvironments) building guide under Eclipse
Alex Roper <calmofthestorm@gmail.com>

This file explains how to download and build all necessary modules to run JavaTanksoar, JavaEaters, or both using Eclipse.
If you just want to build the projects, consider using the batch file method instead as it is much quicker and easier.

First, you must check out all the necessary modules to make soar-library, as detailed elsewhere.

Download Eclipse from the internet, and unzip. Once you have chosen a workspace, click "File->New->Project...". Select 
"Checkout project from CVS" under the CVS heading:
	Host: winter.eecs.umich.edu
	Repository path: /cvsroot/soar
	Connection type: extssh


Enter the proper credentials and other information, and select "use an existing module" then "JavaBaseEnvironment" as well as JavaTanksoar and/or JavaEaters.
(be sure to select "checkout into workspace as projects" when that dialog comes up.

Next you must import the sml and swt jars from your soar-library folder. (Tip: you can click and drag from your window manager)
Right click on the JavaBaseEnvironment project, select "Import...". Select "File system" and then
browse to your soar-library folder and select sml.jar and the appropriate swt jar for your operating system. When done, click "finish". 

Note that execution will fail unless you also place the libraries SoarKernelSML, ElementXML, and Java_sml_ClientInterface in the project
directory (either with Eclipse import or just moving it there). You'll also need an SWT library (they're in soar-library).

To execute, choose "Run->Run..." and double click on "Java Application". For Project select either JavaEaters or JavaTanksoar,
and for main class select either TanksoarJ or Eaters. Then click run. (Tip: CTRL+F11 is run last launched run, and F11 is debug
last run)

Note that if you use my directions you must reimport libraries after rebuilding.

Note that if you modify the files outside Eclipse you must sync Eclipse with the filesystem (IE select each project in the explorer
and hit F5)
