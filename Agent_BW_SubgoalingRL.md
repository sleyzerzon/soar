# Blocks-World Subgoaling Agent with Reinforcement Learning #
This agent incorporates both operator subgoaling/means ends analysis with reinforcement learning.  All search control knowledge (operator evaluation rules) are removed from blocks-world-operator-subgoaling and instead there are RL rules supplemented with rules to compute reward, both in the top state and the substate.  Implemented for four blocks.
