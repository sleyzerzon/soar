Soar 9.0.0 Release Notes
========================

This release of Soar begins the 9.x series of releases during which we 
expect to introduce several new mechanisms. 9.0.0 includes reinforcement
learning code (Soar-RL), which was first released alongside the 8.6.4
beta. 9.0.0 is also the first release to include the SML interface 
without gSKI.

Soar-RL is the architectural integration of reinforcement learning 
(RL) with Soar.  The RL mechanism will automatically learn value 
functions as a Soar agent executes.  These value functions represent, 
for a given working memory state and proposed operator, the expected 
sum of future rewards the agent will receive if it selects that 
operator.  

Soar-9.0.0 includes all source code, many demo programs, and a 
number of applications that serve as examples of how to interface 
Soar to an external Environment.  There is support for integrating 
Soar with C++, Java, Tcl, Python and C# applications.  Many Tools
that aid in development of Soar programs are also included.

These Release Notes describe the primary changes in this 
latest release.  More detailed information can be obtained at

This release was generated for Windows, Linux, and OSX systems.  
Windows XP and Vista are supported.

Installation Requirements
=========================

* On Windows, the 19MB download file expands to ~45MB when extracted.  
  Linux and OSX disk requirements are similar.

* Java 1.5.0 or newer is required to use the Java applications,
  including the debugger (Java must be available in the path). Get it 
  at http://java.sun.com/. Most operating systems probably already have 
  Java installed. NOTE: Java 1.4.2 is no longer supported.

* If you want to run Tcl applications on Linux, Tcl 8.4.x or later is
  required (note that the tutorial applications are now available in
  Java).  Also note that we do not currently support threaded builds
  of Tcl (e.g. ActiveTcl 8.4.11.2 or later).

* The included Python libraries support Python 2.4.  Python 2.5 support
  requires a rebuild of the ClientSMLPython project.

Build Requirements
==================
Binaries are released for Windows/Linux/OS X, so building is not required.
For those on other platforms or developers:
* On all platforms, SWIG 1.3.31 or later is required to build with 
  cross-language support (e.g. to use the Java debugger).
* On Windows, Visual Studio 2005 SP1 is required.
* On Linux/Unix/OS X, Python, SCons, gcc 3.3 or later required.

Components of Soar 9.0.0
========================
* Pre-built libraries and executables for Windows (SoarLibrary/bin)
* all source code, config files, and OS tools for automated Soar builds
* SoarJavaDebugger 
* VisualSoar
* JavaEaters, JavaTankSoar, TclEaters
* Test and Demo programs
* Documentation

New in 9.0.0
============

* Components and Capabilities added
  -- New "gp" command added. Generates rules based on simple patterns
     (intended for use with RL).
  -- Updated selection space to remove local negations (prevents some
     chunking problems), added iterative deepening support.
  -- The item count is generated architecturally in a tie impasse.
  -- Depth at which productions are firing is reported at watch 5.
  -- New "single compilation unit" build configurations on Windows 
     (greatly speeds build time).
  -- Unit test suite added.
  -- Other minor enhancements.

* Bug fixes
  -- Output link supports circular structures.
  -- Duplicate productions no longer cause sourcing to stop.
  -- Various memory leaks fixed.
  -- Several other minor fixes.

* Other updates
  -- Removed gSKI (~20% speed increase in many cases).
  -- The Soar Java Debugger now uses its default layout the first time
     it is run with a new version of Soar. Old layouts are preserved
     and can be loaded if desired (which makes them the default).


Known issues:
=============

* ^status complete appears on the ^output-link immediately instead 
  of during the next input phase.
* The Soar 7 mode implementation currently relies on an ugly hack. If
  you experience problems in this mode, please let us know.
* Many other minor issues (see bugzilla for details).
