#This is a modification of the simple-bot from the Soar tutorial.
#The find-energy subgoal has been added to use episodic memory 
#to find the energy charger.
#

#29 May 06
#This version differs from the original implementation in
#that the epmem retrievals occur in a subgoal and
#the relevant results of the retrieval are placed on 
#the top state via the ^energy-path elaboration.
#This is in preparation for doing multiple step
#paths to the energy charger.
