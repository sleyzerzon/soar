   | |Mode 0 is the base mode. O-support is calculated based on the         |
   | |structure of working memory that is tested and modified. Testing an   |
   |0|operator or operator acceptable preference results in state or        |
   | |operator augmentations being o-supported. The support computation is  |
   | |very complex (see soar manual).                                       |

   |-+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | |Mode 2 is the same as mode 0 except that all support is calculated the|
   |2|production structure, not from working memory structure. Augmentations|
   | |of operators are still o-supported.                                   |
   |-+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | |Mode 3 is the same as mode 2 except that operator elaborations (adding|
   |3|attributes to operators) now get i-support even though you have to    |
   | |test the operator to elaborate an operator.                           |
   |-+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |4|Mode 4 is the default.                                                |

                                  Description

   The o-support-mode command is used to control the way that o-support is
   determined for preferences. Only o-support modes 3 & 4 can be considered
   current to Soar8, and o-support mode 4 should be considered an improved
   version of mode 3. The default o-support mode is mode 4.

   In o-support modes 3 & 4, support is given production by production; that
   is, all preferences generated by the RHS of a single instantiated
   production will have the same support. The difference between the two
   modes is in how they handle productions with both operator and
   non-operator augmentations on the RHS. For more information on o-support
   calculations, see the relevant appendix in the Soar manual.

   Running o-support-mode with no arguments prints out the current
   o-support-mode.
