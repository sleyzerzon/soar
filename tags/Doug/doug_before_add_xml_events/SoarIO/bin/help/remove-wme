                                  Description

   The remove-wme command removes the working memory element with the given
   timetag. This command is provided primarily for use in Soar input
   functions; although there is no programming enforcement, add-wme should
   only be called from registered input functions to create working memory
   elements on Soar's input link.

   Beware of weird side effects, including system crashes.

                                    Warnings

   remove-wme should never be called from the RHS: if you try to match a wme
   on the LHS of a production, and then remove the matched wme on the RHS,
   Soar will crash.

   If used other than by input and output functions interfaced with Soar,
   this command may have weird side effects (possibly even including system
   crashes). Removing input wmes or context/impasse wmes may have unexpected
   side effects. You've been warned.
