       * @brief Reinitializes the agent
       *
       * Agents are initialized when added to the agent manager.  Call this
       *  method to reinitialize an agent that has already been initialized one
       *  or more times in the past.
       *
       * The initialization process erases all current working memory and
       *  all current production memory.  If you only want to erase working
       *  memory and keep production memory and any old settings, use
       *  the IAgentManager::ReinitializeWithOldSettings method.
       *
       * Agents can be running when you call Reinitialize.  In this case the
       *  agent will be reinitialized at the next available stop time
       *  (see IAgentThreadGroup::Stop).  During reinitialization, the thread
       *  group running the agent is paused.  After reinitialization, the 
       *  agent begins executing (assuming it is active, see IAgent::SetActive)
       *  again along with other agents in its thread group.
       *
       * Agents are initialized to the STOP state.  @see gSKIRunState
       *
       * Possible Errors:
       *   @li Any error returned by IProductionManager::LoadSoarFile if a production filename
       *         is supplied and the file doesn't exist or is somehow not usable (e.g. bad format)
       *
       * @param prodFileName (Optional) Name of a soar production file to load with the agent.  
       *                      If you don't want to load a production file with the agent, set
       *                      this parameter to 0.
       * @param learningOn  Pass true to initialize learning to on for this agent
       *                     Pass false to disable learning for this agent.  You
       *                     can change the learning setting after the agent
       *                     is created (even while it is running).
       * @param  oSupportMode O support mode to use for this agent.  The o-support
       *                      mode determines how o-support is calculated for
       *                      wmes.  You can only set the o-support mode when 
       *                      initializing agents. See egSKIOSupportMode for mode details.
       * @param  err Pointer to client-owned error structure.  If the pointer

       *               information.  If it is 0 (the default) extended error

       *
