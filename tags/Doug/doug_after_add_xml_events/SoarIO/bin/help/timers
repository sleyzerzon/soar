                                  Description

   This command is used to control the timers that collect internal profiling
   information while Soar is running. With no arguments, this command prints
   out the current timer status. Timers are ENABLED by default. The default
   compilation flags for soar enable the basic timers and disable the
   detailed timers. The timers command can only enable or disable timers that
   have already been enabled with compiler directives. See the stats command
   for more info on the Soar timing system.

   To show how to use the command in context, do this:

 command --option arg

   and possibly explain the results.
