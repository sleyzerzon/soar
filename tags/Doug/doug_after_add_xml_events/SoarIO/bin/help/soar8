                                  Description

   The soar8 command allows users to revert to Soar 7 methodology in order to
   run older Soar programs. Both production memory and working memory must be
   empty to toggle between Soar 7 and Soar 8 mode. The soar8 command with no
   arguments returns the current mode, the default is Soar 8. Users can
   toggle between modes ONLY when production memory and working memory are
   both empty. This means that users must either change the mode at startup
   before any productions are loaded, or must first issue "excise -all"
   (which does an "init-soar" as well) before changing modes. Note that there
   are differences in the preference mechanism and in operator termination
   (among other things) between Soar 8 and Soar 7. Users should read the Soar
   8.2 Release Notes for more details.
