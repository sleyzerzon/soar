                                  Description

   This command provides some interpretation of backtraces generated during
   chunking. If no option is given, then a list of all chunks and
   justifications is printed.

   The two most useful variants are:

 explain-backtraces prodname
 explain-backtraces name n

   The first variant lists all of the conditions for the named chunk or
   justification, and the ground which resulted in inclusion in the
   chunk/justification. A ground is a working memory element (WME) which was
   tested in the supergoal. Just knowing which WME was tested may be enough
   to explain why the chunk/justification exists. If not, the conditions can
   be listed with an integer value. This value can be used in
   explain-backtraces name n to obtain a list of the productions which fired
   to obtain this condition in the chunk/justification (and the crucial WMEs
   tested along the way). Why use an integer value to specify the condition?
   To save a big parsing job.

   save_backtraces mode must be on when a chunk or justification is created
   or no explanation will be available.
