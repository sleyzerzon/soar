                                  Description

   The gds-print command is a debugging command for examining the Goal
   Dependency Set (GDS) for each goal in the stack. See the Soar manual for
   details.

                                    Warnings

   gds-print horribly inefficient and should not generally be used except
   when something is going wrong and you need to examine the Goal Dependency
   Set.

                               Structured Output

   gds-print simply returns the gds info in a formatted string, this needs to
   be re-done.--Jonathan 12:02, 7 Feb 2005 (EST)
