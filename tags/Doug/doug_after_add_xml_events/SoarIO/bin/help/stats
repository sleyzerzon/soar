                                  Description

   This command prints Soar internal statistics. The module indicates the
   component of interest. If specified, module must be one of --system,
   --memory, or --rete. All statistics are listed for that module.

   This prints all statistics in the --system module:

 stats --system

   timers

   [edit]

                                A Note on Timers

   The current implementation of Soar uses a number of timers to provide
   time-based statistics for use in the stats command calculations. These
   timers are:
   total CPU time total kernel time phase kernel time (per phase) phase
   callbacks time (per phase) input function time output function time
   Total CPU time is calculated from the time a decision cycle (or number of
   decision cycles) is initiated until stopped. Kernel time is the time spent
   in core Soar functions. In this case, kernel time is defined as the all
   functions other than the execution of callbacks and the input and output
   functions. The total kernel timer is only stopped for these functions. The
   phase timers (for the kernel and callbacks) track the execution time for
   individual phases of the decision cycle (i.e., input phase, preference
   phase, working memory phase, output phase, and decision phase). Because
   there is overhead associated with turning these timers on and off, the
   actual kernel time will always be greater than the derived kernel time
   (i.e., the sum of all the phase kernel timers). Similarly, the total CPU
   time will always be greater than the derived total (the sum of the other
   timers) because the overhead of turning these timers on and off is
   included in the total CPU time. In general, the times reported by the
   single timers should always be greater than than the corresponding derived
   time. Additionally, as execution time increases, the difference between
   these two values will also increase. For those concerned about the
   performance cost of the timers, all the run time timing calculations can
   be compiled out of the code by defining NO_TIMING_STUFF (in soarkernel.h)
   before compilation.
