# Classic AI problems implemented for Soar 8.5
#
# Blocks-World: Stack blocks
#    Demonstrates simple search, look-ahead, and operator-subgoaling.
# Eight-Puzzle: Sliding tile puzzle.
#    Demonstrates look-ahead search and chunking.
#    Has graphical interface using tcl
# MAC: Missionaries and Cannibals
#    Has two versions, both of which using look-ahead search 
#    and chunking showing tradeoffs in state representations for
#    operator application vs. state copying.
# Towers-of-hanoi: Classic disk and peg problem
#    Two strategies implemented - no search or learning.
#    Multiple implementations of one of the strategies using 
#    different representations with different generality and different
#    execution costs
# Waterjug:
#    Has two versions, both of which using look-ahead search 
#    and chunking showing tradeoffs in state representations for
#    operator application vs. state copying.
#    
# Default:
#    Holds rules used for implementing common problem solving
#    strategies including look ahead search
