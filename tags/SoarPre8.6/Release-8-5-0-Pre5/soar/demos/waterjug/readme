# ABSTRACT. These Soar productions implement the waterjug task.
# The task is to find the sequence of steps that fill the three-gallon 
# jug with one gallon of water.  There is a well that has an infinite
# amount of water, a five-gallon jug, and a three-gallon jug.
#
# Two versions: 
#
# waterjug.soar
#    Simple impasse-free problem solving without planning.
# waterjug-planning.soar
#    Same formulation as in waterjug.soar, but has additional
#     rules to support lookahead planning. Automatically loads
#     in required default rules. Chunking also works with this.
#
# These systems are covered in the Soar 8 Tutorial Part III and IV.
