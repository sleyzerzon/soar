1. "Cannot find package Soar" when trying to create an agent.

2. "Tcl84.dll not found" or "Tk84.dll not found"

3. When I double-click on the VisualSoar jar file, it pops up an error box
that says it can't find the main class and is exiting?  What gives?

1. "Cannot find package Soar" when trying to create an agent.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Possibility 1: Wrong version of Tcl.

The most common cause of this problem is that the wrong version of
Tcl is installed.  This version of Soar requires Tcl 8.4.6 (it may
also work with later versions).

The Windows distribution actually includes the
correct version of Tcl, so as long as you use the batch files that
are included to start Soar, it will use the version of Tcl we included.
If you are trying to run the Tcl files directly, then it will use
whatever version of Tcl is registered with the OS (the version
included with Soar is NOT registered with the OS).

On other platforms (i.e. *nix, Mac), make sure that you have
installed Tcl 8.4.6.  Some unusual versions of Unix may have to
get the source and compile it themselves.

Possibility 2: Soar is not compiled.

If you only installed the source code or
have removed any of the binaries at some point, you may get this
message.  Reinstall or follow the instructions in the INSTALL file
to build the binaries.

Possibility 3: Wrong location of Soar is specified.

If you are trying to run an application like Eaters or TankSoar,
it is possible that the application is looking in the wrong place
for Soar.  The applications we distributed with Soar are set up to
look in the right place, but if you have moved Soar or the
applications, you may need to edit these files:

Eaters: The file init-eaters.tcl specifies the location of Soar
on the line beginning with "set soar_library".  It is specified
as a relative path, although you can replace this with a full path.

TankSoar: The file init-tanksoar.tcl specifies the location of Soar
on the line beginning with "set soar_library".  It is specified
as a relative path, although you can replace this with a full path.

2. "Tcl84.dll not found" or "Tk84.dll not found"
----------------------------------------------------------------

Possibility 1: Tcl not properly installed.

Wish, the program which starts Tcl (and is used to run Soar,
Eaters and TankSoar), expects these dlls to be in the same directory
as it is.  If they are not (i.e. Tcl is not properly installed),
then there will be problems.  Try reinstalling Tcl.

Possibility 2: The dlls are not in the search path.

If you are trying to run an application which has Tcl compiled
directly into it (i.e. soarside, which is part of SGIO), then
these dlls need to be in the PATH environment variable.  The Soar
installer for Windows should have done this for you.
If you installed ActiveTcl, then the installer should have done
this for you.  If you are manually installing Tcl, then you may
have to do this step yourself.

A:  For some reason, certain java installations are configured incorrectly
to launch java applications in jar files.  We are not exactly sure why this
happens.  To fix the problem, you'll need to edit your registry.  If you
don't feel comfortable editing the registry, you could also just create a
text file whose contents are:

javaw.exe -jar VisualSoar.jar

and save it in the same directory as "start-visualSoar.bat"

Otherwise, open up Regedit and find the following key:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\javaw.exe\shell\open\command

Its current value will probably be something like this:

"C:\j2sdk1.4.2_01\bin\javaw.exe" "%1"

Add a "-jar" between the 2 quoted items and a "%*" to the end.  In the
above example, you would change it to:

"C:\j2sdk1.4.2_01\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%1\" %*

That should allow you to launch VisualSoar by double-clicking the jar
file.
