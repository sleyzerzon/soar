   input-period - For Soar7-mode, controls the rate of input to the Soar

                                  Description

   This command is obsolete for Soar8. In Soar8, input is done at the start
   of every decision cycle.

   For Soar7-mode, the input-period command controls the rate of input to the
   Soar agent. If period is not specified, this command prints the current
   input period. If period is specified, it must be a non-negative integer
   and is used to reset the input period. A period of 0 sets input to occur
   every elaboration cycle. A positive value for period sets Soar to accept
   input only every nth period decision cycles. The default initial setting
   of the input-period parameter is 0.

                                    Example

 input-period 5

   Input is accepted only every 5th decision cycle by the Soar agent. Soar 7
   ONLY.
