                                  Description

   The Goal Dependency Set (GDS) is described in an appendix of the Soar
   manual. This command is a debugging command for examining the GDS for each
   goal in the stack. First it steps through all the working memory elements
   in the rete, looking for any that are included in any goal dependency set,
   and prints each one. Then it also lists each goal in the stack and prints
   the wmes in the goal dependency set for that particular goal. This command
   is useful when trying to determine why subgoals are disappearing
   unexpectedly: often something has changed in the goal dependency set,
   causing a subgoal to be regenerated prior to producing a result.

                                    Warnings

   gds-print is horribly inefficient and should not generally be used except
   when something is going wrong and you need to examine the Goal Dependency
   Set.
