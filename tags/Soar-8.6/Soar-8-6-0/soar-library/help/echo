                                  Description

   This command echos the args to the current output stream. This is normally
   stdout but can be set to a variety of channels. If an arg is -nonewline
   then no newline is printed at the end of the printed strings. Otherwise a
   newline is printed after printing all the given args. Echo is the easiest
   way to add user comments or identification strings in a log file.

                                    Examples

   This example will add these comments to the screen and any open log file.
