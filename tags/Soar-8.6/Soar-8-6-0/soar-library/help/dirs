   This command lists the directory stack. Agents can move through a
   directory structure by pushing and popping directory names. The dirs
   command returns the stack.

   The command pushd places a new "agent current directory" on top of the
   directory stack and cd's to it. The command popd removes the directory at
   the top of the directory stack and cd's to the previous directory which
   now appears at the top of the stack.
