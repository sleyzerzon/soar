Installing TankSoar-3.0.6
-------------------------

TankSoar 3.0.6 is part of the Soar-Suite package and is installed as a component 
of that package.  Installation instructions for Soar-Suite are located in the 
INSTALL file in the soar-8.5.0 directory of the Soar-Suite package and on the Soar 
website:

	http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/
	
__________________________________
Running TankSoar-3.0.6 on Windows:
----------------------------------

Simply double-click the start-tanksoar.bat file.  

This .bat file will run init-tanksoar.tcl using the version of Tcl/Tk 
distributed with Soar-Suite 8.5.0.

_______________________________
Running TankSoar-3.0.6 on Unix:
-------------------------------

On Unix, type this command to run TankSoar:
./init-tanksoar.tcl  

You may need to make the same changes to the first line of the init-tanksoar.tcl 
file that you made to the init-soar.tcl file to point to the location of the 
wish binary on your machine.  For example, if you needed to install ActiveTcl 
when you installed Soar, you would change that first line to: 
#!/usr/local/ActiveTcl/bin/wish
