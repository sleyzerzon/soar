To Start:
--------
For Mac:  double click TankSoar application.

For Windows:  double click either TANKSOAR.BAT or TANKSOARNT.BAT.


Debugging, i.e. having a console window open to type TCL commands:
---------
For Mac:  a console window is always available, so don't worry about doing anything special

For Windows:  Double-click either DEBUG.BAT or DEBUGNT.BAT.  When the console window appears, type "source tanksoar"

Note for windows:  The xset window will remain on the screen.  To eliminate this behavior, right-click on the batch file and select properties.  Under PROGRAM, select the checkbox that says "Close on exit."  It will create a shortcut, but your preferences will be saved for that machine.
