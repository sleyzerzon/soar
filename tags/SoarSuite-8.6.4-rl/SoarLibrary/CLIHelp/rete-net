                                  Description

   The rete-net command saves the current Rete net to a file or restores a
   Rete net previously saved. The Rete net is Soar's internal representation
   of production and working memory; the conditions of productions are
   reordered and common substructures are shared across different
   productions. This command provides a fast method of saving and loading
   productions since a special format is used and no parsing is necessary.
   Rete-net files are portable across platforms that support Soar.

   Normally users wish to save only production memory. Note that
   justifications cannot be present when saving the Rete net. Issuing an
   init-soar before saving a Rete net will remove all justifications and
   working memory elements.
   If the filename contains a suffix of ".Z", then the file is compressed
   automatically when it is saved and uncompressed when it is loaded.
   Compressed files may not be portable to another platform if that platform
   does not support the same uncompress utility.
